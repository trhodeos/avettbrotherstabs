(E) I dreamt of a (B) suit a suit so fine I dressed my words (E) in  
(E) Sewn and tailor (B) made with song in mind made of (E) melody  
(E) Stitched by threads of (B) notes with perfect pitch, perfectly (E)
composed  
(E) Sound in tune and (B) key, a code of rhythm, and (E) harmony

But when I awoke my coat was worn and my words were plain  
Each song that I sang all the notes were wrong and poorly played  
Both my sleeves had holes, my knees were patched, my shoes needed
soles  
No clever disguise no way to hide my offensive tone  
  
But I, I wish for you more than I can give, than I can do  
Yeah you, you deserve the best an anthem not my hand-me-down tune  
Yeah you, you deserve the best an anthem not my hand-me-down tune
