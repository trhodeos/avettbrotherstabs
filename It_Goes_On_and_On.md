# It Goes On and On

  

  
(F) I lost my (Am) fear in your (Dm) arms (C)  
(F) I lost my (Am) tears in your (Dm) car (C)  
(F) I lost my (Am) will in your (Dm) candle-lit (Bb) eyes  
(F) And all my (Am) love in your (Dm) yard (C)  
  
(Bb) Baby would you leave me if you knew that I was making it (F) up  
And (Bb) underneath the love you've got wonder am I'm giving you (F)
up  
No (Am) way am (Bb) I (C)  
It goes (Bb) on  
  
(F) Violent is the motion in my (Am) heart and in my body and (Dm) mind
(Bb)  
And (F) silent is the feeling that I (Am) lost but I'm determined to
(Dm) find (Bb)  
And (F) love is but an ocean, un-(Am)-realistic notion but I (Dm) cling
to her devotion  
And I (Bb) let it pull me down to the (C) floor  
  
It goes (Bb) on...on...(F) on...on...  
It goes (Bb) on...on...(F) on...on...  
It goes (Bb) on........(F) on........  
It goes (Dm) on...(C)...(Bb) on...(C)  
  
(F) I found my (Am) will in your (Dm) car (C)  
(F) I caught my (Am) tears in your (Dm) arms (C)  
(F) I found my-(Am)-self on that (Dm) poor county (Bb) drive  
(F) And found my (Am) love in your (Dm) yard (C)  
  
Oh (Bb) Baby would you leave me if you knew that I was making it (F)
up  
And (Bb) underneath the love you've got wonder am I'm giving you (F)
up  
No (Am) way am (Bb) I (C)  
  
It goes (Bb) on...on...(F) on...on...  
It goes (Bb) on...on...(F) on...on...  
It goes (Bb) on........(F) on........  
It goes (Dm) on...(C) on...(Bb) on  
It goes (Dm) on...(C) on...(Bb) on
