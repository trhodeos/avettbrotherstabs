# Ill with Want

  

(INTRO)  
Em D C (x3)  

D  

(G) I am sick with (C) wanting and it's (G) evil and it's (C)daunting  
How I let everything I cherish lay to waste  
I am lost in greed, this time it's definitely me  
I point fingers but there's no one there to blame  

(CHORUS)  
(C) A need for (B7) something, (Em) now let me (D) break it down (C)
again  
A need for something but not more medicine  

I am sick of wanting and it's evil how it's got me  
And every day is worse than the one before  
The more I have the more I think I'm almost where I need to be  
If only I could get a little more  

A need for something, now let me break it down again  
A need for something but not more medicine  

  
(BRIDGE)  
(G) Something has me, oh (Em) something has me  
Acting (C) like someone I (D) don't wanna (G) be  
Something has me, oh (Em) something has me  
Acting (C) like someone I (D) know isn't (G) me  
Ill with (C) want and poisoned (D) by this ugly (G) greed  

(play intro)

Temporary is my time, ain't nothing on this world that's mine  
Except the will I found to carry on  
Free is not your right to chose  
It's answering what's asked of you  
To give the love you find until it's gone  

A need for something, now let me break it down again  
A need for something but not more medicine  

Something has me, oh something has me  
Acting like someone I don't wanna be  
Something has me, oh something has me  
Acting like someone I know isn't me  
Ill with want and poisoned by this ugly greed  
Ill with want and poisoned by this ugly greed  
Ill with want and poisoned by this ugly greed
