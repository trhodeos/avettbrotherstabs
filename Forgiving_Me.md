# Forgiving Me

(F)I'm no (Am)angel, and (C)neither are (F)you  
But you'd be (Am)ashamed of (G)me if (C)only you (F)knew  
All the (F)terrible (Dm)things I've (F)done  
To (Am)you and to (G)me and to (C)every(F)one  
  
I'm no angel, I'm close with my sin  
But I've made the worst mistake and I've made it again  
And I promised myself I'd stop  
That I would change, but clearly I'm not  
  
So (Am)ask the (Dm)cards to (C)tell me where to (F)go  
(Am)They didn't (Dm)know  
So ask my heart to tell me where to go  
It answered low  
  
I'm no angel, and neither are you  
But I saw the devil at my doorway and I let him through  
And he sat in my dining room  
Took my hands, took my sight, and my memory too  
  
I'm no angel, forget what you've heard  
But my love flies to you like a sick humming bird  
And it's lured away by red  
And laid on the ground from the sugar it's fed  
  
So ask the cards to tell me where to go  
They didn't know  
So ask my heart to tell me where to go  
It answered low  
  
So I said I'm no angel. Do you understand?  
She said you're the one and that's how it is  
And you can't be blamed for the evil that is  
And you cannot be troubled with things that have been  
And you need not worry for me  
My life is what it should be  
Just forgiving you  
  
My life is what it should be  
My life is what it should be  
My life is what it should be  
Just forgiving you
