# Cheap Rum

(Am)Cheap (G)rum (F)slick in my (C)veins  
With (Am)her arms like (G)bone candy (F)canes  
(G)Curling aro(Am)und mine to (G)move them (F)away  
  
Violet parallel streams  
Race behind constant high beams  
Soaring through midnight on feather laced wings  
  
Water fresh in your throat  
And bits of snow rest on your coat  
Notice the sunlight that keeps us afloat
