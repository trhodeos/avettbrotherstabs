# I Can't Remember

**Capo 4**  
  
(C)I can't remember (G)anything I (C)said  
(C)Not from the (Am)time of the (G)rain  
To the (F)end of the (G)game  
Did I (C)tell my secrets that (G)nobody (C)knows?  
Or did I (Am)cry like a (G)boy who's (F)lost his (G)girl?  
  
I don't remember anything I've done  
Not since the night I was born  
To the end of this morning  
My lifetime was blurry like some kind of dream  
One that I didn't have, but maybe I did  
  
Don't be (C)sad, don't be (G)sad  
It (F)can't be that (G)bad  
Don't be (C)sad, don't be (G)sad  
(F)We've all (G)had harder (F)times  
  
I can't remember anything I said  
Not to the girl on the phone  
Or the girl on the road  
Or the girl in my headache covered in lace  
Or to the girl in the frame with glass on her face  
  
Don't be sad, don't be sad  
It can't be that bad  
Don't be sad, don't be sad  
We've all had harder times
