**Banjo**  
**As seen in the crackerfarm video.**  
**Capo 7**

``` 
 d-5------5---4------4--2-----2--0
 b----0----------0--------0-----------
 g------0----------0--------0-----
 d-5----------4---------2--------0
 g-------------------------------
```

This is played in this rendition:

(5)Tear down the (4)house, that (2)I grew up (0)in

Scott then plays variations of the C major scale:

``` 
 d-------------------------
 b-------------------------
 g----0-2/4-2/4-2/4-0-2-0-------------
 d-0h2------------------------
 g-------------------------
```

this is during the:

and I'll never be the same again.

Then restart:

Some other variations after the 5-4-2-0 combo:

``` 
 d-----------------0----0-
 b---------0-----0----0----
 g-----0h2---2/4----0----------
 d--0h2--------------------
 g----------------------
```

The solo he plays in the video goes something like this: (its not spot
on)

``` 
 d-5--4-5-7-5-9-5-2-0-4-5--------------
 b----------------------
 g------------------------
 d-5--4-5-7-5-9-5-2-0-4-5----------------
 g-------------------------
```

with a few rolls played, its a variation of those notes any help would
be appreciated  
  
**Guitar - Capo 4**  
(G)Tear down the (G/F\#)house that (C)I grew up (G)in  
I'll never be the (C)same (G)again  
(G)And take every(G/F\#)thing that (C)I've (G)collected  
(G)And throw it (D)in a (G)pile  
  
Bulldoze the woods that I ran through  
Carry the pictures of me and you  
I have no memory of who I once was  
And I don't remember your name  
  
Park the old car that I loved the best  
Inspection's due, and it won't pass the test  
It's funny how I have to put it to rest  
And how one day I will join it  
  
I remember cryin' over you  
And I don't mean like a couple of tears and I'm blue  
I'm talkin about collapsin and screamin at the moon  
But I'm a better man for havin gone through it  
Yes I'm a better man for havin' gone through  
  
Ever since I learned how to curse  
I've been using those sorry old words  
But I'm talkin' to these children  
And I'm keepin' it clean  
I don't need those words to say what I mean,  
No, I don't need those words to say what I mean  
  
Tear down the house that I grew up in  
I'll never be the same again  
Take everything that I used to own  
And burn it in a pile  
  
Bulldoze the woods that I ran through  
Carry the pictures of me and you  
I have no memory of who I once was  
And I don't remember your name
