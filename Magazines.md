# Magazines

Originally performed by the everybodyfields  
  
(G)Two days and the money's spent  
(Bm)I can't tell you just where I've been  
(Am)I only gamble when I steal  
(C)'Cause I like the way it feels  
  
(G)And my hands still smell like a magazine  
(Bm)I keep having the same old dream  
(Am)If everything is what it seems  
(C)Something's wrong; I'm (D7)off to sleep  
  
White knuckles on a baseball bat  
And I know just where I'm at  
The sun shone just like David Copperfield  
Daddy tell me it's not real  
  
Two feet knee-deep in doubt  
Around the bases and home I'm out  
But if you're never home I doubt  
You will ever see me out  
  
(G)The parking lot is a hiding place  
(Bm)'Cause under the cars  
You can't (Bbm)see my face(Am)(C)
