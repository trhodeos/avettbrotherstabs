# Swept Away (Sentimental Version)

Well (G)you send my life a (C)whirling  
(C)darling when you're (G)twirling  
on the (D)floor  
  
Who cares about tomorrow  
What more is tomorrow  
than another day  
  
When (Em)you (C)swept me (G)away  
Yeah you swept me away  
  
I see the end of the rainbow  
but what more is a rainbow  
than colors out of reach?  
If you come down to my  
window, and I climb out my  
window, then we'll get out of  
reach, and you swept me away  
  
You said with such honest feeling  
but what'd you really mean when  
you said that I'm your man  
  
Well how my darling can it be  
when you have never seen me  
and you never will again  
that you swept me away  
  
Life is ever changing  
but I will always find  
a constant and comfort in your love  
  
With your heart my soul is bound  
and as we dance I know that  
heaven can be found
