# Sounds of the Season Ending

**Capo III**  
  
(G)My ceiling is just a washed out sky  
With dead or dying moths within the (C)light (Em)  
(Am)I would lie down happily  
And (C)follow them whereever they are (G)going  
  
Is this the worst you've ever seen  
My head is just a pinball machine  
Without any bumpers  
To help me keep my thoughts from rolling out  
  
Tell me you can skip the day  
And head out with me to the mountains  
Theres no need to stay and work  
They will get along just fine without you  
  
I have my candles lit  
My living room looks like a funeral parlor  
My mother says it's dangerous  
But she doesn't know how far I plan on going  
  
So what good is a loving girl?  
If'n she is gone in the morning  
Sunlight slides across my floor  
I swear to God I wish I'd never met her  
  
I'm not gonna tell a girl  
How much she ought to love me  
You shouldn't have to tell someone  
You shouldn't have to tell them what they're missing  
  
So if you're out there listening  
I don't want nobody to be sorry  
Just help me pray to God above  
To send some snow before the season's over
