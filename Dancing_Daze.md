# Dancing Daze

(G)I've seen the (A7)way you deal with (D)things  
(G)The trouble (A7)that this life will (D)bring  
(G)If it gets to (A7)you then I can (D)tell by the way you (Bm)sing  
(G)You act like it just (A7)doesn't mean a (D)thing  
  
(G)I see you dancing all your, (A7)dancing all you, (D)dancing all your
(Bm)daze  
(G)maybe you can (A7)tell me how it (D)is you got that (Bm)way  
(G)Dancing all you, (A7)dancing all your (D)dancing all your (Bm)daze  
(G)come on come on there's (A7)got to be a (D)way  
  
there's all these things that get me down  
this dirty world is full of clowns  
they pick you up just so they can knock you down  
laugh at you while your there on the ground  
  
Your dancing all your, dancing all you, dancing all your daze  
maybe you can tell me how it is you got that way  
Dancing all you, dancing all your dancing all your daze  
come on come on there's got to be a way  
  
I really like the way it feels, I look at you and Its real...
