# A Lover Like You

The capo should be placed at 2nd fret if you want to be in the correct
key. Otherwise put it where it's easiest to sing for yourself.

  
(G)Do I need to tell you? I don't (Em)need to be untrue  
(Am)Not when I have a (C)lover like you.  
  
(G)(C)(G)(D)  
  
Now it don't (G)take that much thought  
Not with (Em)all the love you've got  
and you (G)give it to me free  
some might (Em)take that for granted  
but certainly not me  
no (Am)not when I have a (C)lover like you  
  
Chorus  
(Em)I haven't eyes (C)for anyone else  
(Em)I'm thinking of you (C)and nobody else  
(Em)I havenâ€™t eyes for (C)anyone else but (Am)You.....(C)You....(D)...  
  
She may be (G)all on my case  
Want to (Em)kiss me on my face  
Put my (G)hands on her waist  
Take me (Em)back to her place  
I would happily follow  
but (Am)not when I have a (C)lover  
Like (G)you.  
  
Chorus  
(Em)I haven't eyes (C)for anyone else  
(Em)I'm thinking of you and (C)nobody else  
(Em)I haven't eyes for (C)anyone else  
but (Am)you......(D)

(G) (C) (G) (D) Repeat 'till end.
