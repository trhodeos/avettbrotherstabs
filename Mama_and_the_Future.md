# Mama and the Future

(C)Mama, (D)will you still (G)call me your (C)son  
(C)When I am (D)broken and too (G)tired to (C)run  
(D)Through a (G)life that (D)knows no (G)direction  
(G)Down a (A)path I (C)built with my (D)dreams  
  
Mama, can you hear my voice in the wind  
Well I called for you like I did when I was ten  
Frozen by the copperheads that crowd at my feet  
Now the snakes are big city streets  
  
Well (C)I am (G)alone  
(D)Singing to (C)myself  
(D)Hoping no one (Bm)else  
(G)Remembers that I (C)failed  
Made (D)nothing of (Bm)myself  
Oh (C)mama, (D)will you (C)care? (D) (G)  
  
Mama, I can see you're scared for you son  
You can see me burning out when I am done  
Reaching high up on my toes  
For dreams that won't come true but that's how it goes  
  
And I know I am alone  
Singing to myself  
Hoping no one else  
Remembers that I failed  
Made nothing of myself  
Oh mama, will you care?
