# Down With the Shine

Add a Capo anywhere you like\!  
  
(G)Down with the shine, the (Am)perfect shine  
That (C)poisons the well and (D7)ruins my mind  
I get (G)took for a ride (Am)every time  
(C)Down with the (D7)glistening (G)shine  
  
It's (G)in with the new, and (Am)out with the old  
(C)Out goes the warm and (D7)in comes the cold  
It's the (G)most predictable (Am)story told  
(C)In with the young, (D7)out with the old(G)  
  
Chorus  
A bellyful of high-dollar wine  
A fat hand, a fat wallet too  
Things change and get strange with the movement of time  
It's happening right now to you  
  
It's a (D)real bad (D7)time to bring up the (G)truth  
Though we (D)searched, we (D7)found no fountain of (G)youth  
Not in (B7)Spain, nowhere (Em)near  
Any(B7)where close to (C)here(D7)  
  
Nothing's good, because nothing lasts  
And all that comes here, comes here to pass  
I would voice my pain, but the change wouldn't last  
All that comes, it comes here to pass
