 Brackets indicated barre chords, i.e., [G]
 
 
 [G]Gotta go back to California
 [C]Got some business out [Eb]the-[D]-re
 [C]Tonight it's gonna freeze
 [C]Out [Eb]there it's 80 [D]degrees
 [G]And I have to go back
 Yes I [Eb]have to go [D]back
 
 Gotta go back to California
 Gotta a few songs in my head
 So sooner than we planned
 To make a record with the band
 And I have to go back 
 Yes I have to go back
 
 [C]Yes you know my [G]baby
 (Em)I'll sure be missing (A7)you
 [C]But I won't be in my [G]bare feet
 (Em)in sunny (B7)Malibu
 [C]I'll be working [G]daily
 from (Em)early 'til (A7)late
 Won't [C]get to ride my bike across the [Eb]mighty Golden [D]Gate
 
 Gotta go back to California
 Used to take us 5 days
 To get form here to there
 Now it's 5 hours in the air
 But it still can be a drag
 Watch some stranger search my bag
 
 Gotta go back to California
 Got no time for Hollywood
 To see the movie stars
 With plastic surgery scars
 But I have to go back
 yes I have to go back
 
 Yes you know my baby
 I'll sure be missing you
 But I won't be in my bare feet
 in lovely Malibu
 I'll be working daily
 from early 'til late
 Won't get to ride my bike across the mighty Golden Gate
 
 Gotta go back to California
 If we find a day off
 See if ALice is around
 Rent a car, drive it down
 Fresh lemon in a glass
 Quesadillas on the stove
 
 Yes you know my baby
 I'll sure be missing you
 But I won't be in my bare feet
 in lovely Malibu
 I'll be working daily
 from early 'til late
 Won't get to ride my bike across the mighty Golden Gate
