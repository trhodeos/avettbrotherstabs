# For Today

Originally performed by Jessica Lea Mayfield  
Slap on a capo anywhere you like\!  
  
(G)I was walking with your (C)left hand in my back pocket  
(G)I stared at the sky while you (C)kissed me  
(G)you were running away  
(C)away from everything  
(G)I stayed behind so you'd (C)miss me  
  
(D)while these words sound so (C)sweet  
I could (G)care less about you  
(C)care less about you  
(G)I love the sound of (C)you walking away  
and I can  
(G)see clearer and Im (C)getting closer  
(G)to finding out just who I am  
(C)without you in the way  
(D)so hold me  
(C)but only  
(G)for today  
  
despite my best ambitions  
I get in to the worst situations  
but here I am crystal clear....
