# Offering

(G)Babe I’m (C)lost  
Cause I don’t know what to (G)say  
Mmmmm, I (Em)love you  
(D)Wanna make you my wife (G)someday  
  
Don’t wanna steal you  
Of a young woman’s life  
To me its perfect  
Just wanna do you right  
  
I’ve known others  
And I've loved others too  
But I loved them cause they were stepping stones  
On a staircase to you  
  
Sometimes I act foolish  
I don’t know what to do  
Please babe try not to judge me  
For my offering is true  
  
And I dream of children  
We can call our own  
Watch em run around in the front yard  
From the front porch of our home  
  
To me its perfect  
Just wanna do you right
