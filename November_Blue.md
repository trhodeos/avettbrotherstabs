# November Blue

(C)If I weren't (G)leaving, (Am)would (G)I (F)catch (G)you (C)dreamin'
(Em7/B) (C)  
And if I weren't gonna be gone now, could I take you home  
And if I told you I loved you, would it change what you see  
And if I was staying, would you stay with me  
And if I had money, would it all look good  
And if I had a job now, like a good man should  
And if I came to you tomorrow, and said let's run away  
Would you roll like the wind does, baby, would you stay  
  
My heart is dancing, to a November tune  
And I hope that you hear it, singing songs about you  
And I sing songs of sorrow, because you're not around  
See, babe, I'm gone tomorrow  
Baby, follow me down  
  
I don't know why I have to, but this man must move on  
I love my time here, didn't know 'til I was gone  
November shadows, shade November change  
November spells sweet memory, the season blue remains  
November spells sweet memory, the season blue remains  
  
Your yellow hair is like the sunlight, however sweet it shines  
Bit by the cold of December, I'm warm inside your smile  
Oh lady, tell me I'm not leaving, you're everything I dreamed  
I'm killing myself thinking, I've fallen like the leaves  
I'm killing myself thinking, I've fallen like the leaves
