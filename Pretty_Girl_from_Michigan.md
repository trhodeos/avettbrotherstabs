Can you not (C)see what you've (Em)done  
  
you (F)gave your heart (G7)away I didn't (C)want to fall in (Em)love  
with (F)anyone but you (G7)dear  
I can still (C)hear the (Em)songs  
the (F)melody (G7)behind the kiss you (C)gave me you were (Em)wrong  
I was (F)right so I walked (G7)away  
and let you dance alone  
I got so tired of talking on the telephone  
How many times would we say the words goodbye?  
  
I've made mistakes  
and one was telling you that I'd be there when summertime had come  
I should have said I did not care  
oh the time I would have saved  
If I had been less willing to accomodate  
you'd been a little less likely to cry  
  
(Am)you go back to the (Em)high life  
(Am)I'll go back to the (Em)low  
I (F)shoulda known  
but (G7)now I know  
  
there'll be no words from you  
describing how it felt to go through what I put you through  
It all makes perfect sense  
when you cut the rope that kept you dangling from such  
pitiful amounts of hope  
I would've cut it too
