 C                        G
 Hard to believe I won't see you again
 Am                          Em7
 We were just fighting when winter began
 F                         G                                C       G
 The coldness of our words competing with the wind from the north.
 
 C                                  G
 Still they make me shiver but in a very different way
 Am                             Em7
 The pages of the calendar kept turning away              
 F                                 G                           C      G
 I have some better words now but it's too late to say them to you.
 
 My dream of all dreams and my hope of all hopes
 Is only to tell you and make sure you know
 How much I love you and how much I always did.
 
 And yes I know you loved me, I can see it in your eyes
 And it was in your struggle and it was in your mind
 And it was in the smile you gave me when I was a kid
 
            C       Am        G
 Feels like no one understands
 C        Am      G
 And now my only chance
     F       G      C       Em7   Am
 To talk to you is through  my   prayers.
        F          G             C
 I only wanted to tell you I cared
 
 Every night after and every day since,
 I found myself crying when the memory hit.
 Sometimes it knocks me down, sometimes I just put it away.
 
 Down in my mind where I don't care to go
 The pain of a lesson is letting me know
 If you have love in your heart let it show while you can
 
 Yes now I understand
 But now my only chance
 To talk to you is through my prayers.
 I only wanted to tell you I cared.
 I only wanted to tell you I cared.
