# Rain On My Tin Roof

**Capo I**  
  
If you could (G)only come (D)by here (G)today  
Maybe the (Am)hours we (D)spend wouldn't (B7)waste us (C)away  
Like the (G)rain (D)on (Em)my (C)tin (G)roof  
  
It is a wonderful day to remain  
Indoors where grey open windows will calmly relate  
For the rain on my tin roof  
  
I (Em)know I (Am)know that (D)you have to (C)go  
(G)Back to the (D)place you came (C)from (D)  
  
I miss that look that you have on your face  
While you are sleepily breathing and all I am hearing  
Is rain on my tin roof  
  
And if there were ever a reason to stay  
Turn off my phone and become one with you and my bed  
It's the rain on my tin roof  
  
I know I know that you have to go  
Back to the place you came from  
I know I know that you have to go  
Back to the place you came from
