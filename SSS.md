(G)I (C)never thought I'd (G)could (C)feel the way I (G)do  
(C)When I'm in your (G)arms  
(D)Ba da ba ba  
  
Sing your melody to me  
But if you want me to leave\\ I'd walk away from this old farm  
Ba da ba ba  
  
(B7)Baby, baby, (C)there ain't no cows left for milking  
(B7)Baby, baby, there (C)ain't no chickens laying nothing  
  
(G)I'll walk on (C)anything for (G)you  
I'll walk on anything for you  
I'll walk off on anything for you  
I'll walk off on anything for you  
  
I was always told that I would find somebody  
I could keep a promise for  
Ba da ba ba  
  
But it don't mean a thing  
To a broken-hearted man  
I felt that way before  
Ba da ba ba  
  
Baby, baby, I don't remember feeling that way  
Baby, baby, and I owe it all to you  
  
I'd take a nine to five for you  
I'll take that nine to five for you  
I'd take a nine to five for you  
I'll work that nine to five for you  
  
I'm convinced that's nothings true  
Just cause love worked out for you  
Don't impress me no more  
Ba da ba ba  
  
Words that don't mean a thing to me  
I'm a broken-hearted man  
I got dreams but nothing to hope for  
Ba da ba ba  
  
Lady, lady, keep your distance I mean no good  
Lady, lady, I'm broken-hearted and I think the world should  
  
All be broken-hearted too  
All be broken-hearted too  
All be broken-hearted too  
You all should be broken-hearted too  
  
I'd like to give all my pain to you  
If I could I'd give all my pain to you
