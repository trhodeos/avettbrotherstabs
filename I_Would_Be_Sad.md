# I Would Be Sad

**Capo I**  
  
(G)I would (G/F\#)be (Em)sad because you (C)left me all (G)alone.  
(G)I would (G/F\#)be (Em)sad because the (C)lies that you had (G)told.  
(G)I would (G/F\#)be (Em)sad because I (C)got left by a (D)girl that
(G)I adore.  
(G)I would (G/F\#)be (Em)sad because the (C)love I had (G)before.  
(G)I meant what I said when I said (Em)I would settle down with you
(C)although I know it's not  
something that (D)you were asking me to do.  
And I know we are young but we won't always be, so marry me; lets not be
that predictable young  
couple changing, moving on.  
But I can tell by watching you that theres no chance of pushing
through.  
The odds are so against us; you know most young love it ends like
this.  
  
I would be sad because you left me all alone.  
I would be sad because the lies that you had told.  
I would be sad because I got left by a girl that I adore.  
I would be sad for all the love I had before.  
  
(G)I meant what I said when (Em)I said I would (C)rearrange my (D)plans
and change for (G)you.  
You know me; I've always been the kind with easy confidence.  
Confident enough to honestly beleive that nothing out there stopping me
especially not someone  
who's not loving me.  
Now listen here I told you I could live on with out loving you.  
  
One different part---\>  
(C)I was bluffing then, but it seems that (D)just might have been the
truth.  
  
Well my dad told me, "One day son, this girl will think of what she's
done and hurting you will be  
the first of many more  
regrets to come." And he said, "If she doesn't call, then it's her fault
and it's her loss."  
I say, "It's not that simple see, but then again it just may be."  
  
I would be sad because you left me all alone.  
I would be sad for the lies that you had told.  
I would be sad because I got left by a girl that I adored.  
I would be sad for all the love I had before.  
I would be sad for all the love I had before.
