# My Last Song to Jenny

**Capo II**  
  
(G)Oh tell me (D)please  
That I don’t have to (Em)read  
(G)Between the (C)lines  
  
(G)Hey this is (D)me  
And you don’t have to (Em)keep  
(G)Something heavy on your (C)mind  
  
(D)Did you (G)sleep  
(D)Not a (G)wink  
(Bm)Well (G)neither did (C)I  
  
I've never been too good at reading in  
Between the lines  
So babe spell it out  
But you don’t have to shout  
When you’re talking to me  
  
Do you care, Are you there  
Well neither am I  
  
Don’t lock your door  
Everyone is poor  
Between the lines  
And I could never steal  
The sadness that you feel  
When you’re changing your mind  
  
Oh my dear, Can you hear  
Well neither can I  
  
I wanna live and I want you to live  
Happy and free  
But I don’t how to separate the now  
From what used to be  
  
Will you sleep, not a wink  
Well neither will I
