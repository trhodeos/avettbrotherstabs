# Tin Man

**Capo 2**  
  
(G) You can't be like me  
But be (Am) happy that you can't  
I see (Am) pain but I don't feel it I am (C) like the old tin (G) man  
I'm as (G) warm as a stone  
I keep it (Am) steady as I can  
I see (Am) pain but I don't feel it I am (C) like the old tin (G) man  
(Am) I miss it  
(C) I miss it  
(G) Oh, I miss that (D) feeling of (C) feeling  
I (G) used to fill the sky around with (Am) happiness and joy  
I had (Am) news to give the wind to keep my (C) sails and heart (G)
employed  
I felt (G) people move around me  
I felt (Am) loneliness and shame  
Back then (Am) every day was different now each (C) moment is the (G)
same  
(Am) I miss it  
(C) I miss it  
(G) Oh, I miss that (D) feeling of (C) feeling  
The (D) feeling of (C)feeling  
The (G) wind upon my face  
And (Em) caring what it brings this (Am) way  
The (D) feeling of (C) feeling  
The (G) minutes pass away  
And (Em) caring what I do with (Am) them  
(Bm) Maybe bring me love or something (C) else  
(C)(B)(C)(D)(E)(D)(E)(F\#)(G)  
(G) And so it goes a man grows cold  
Some would (Am) say a man grows strong  
They say (Am) life only grows short  
I say the (C) road only grows (G) long  
But as (G) long as there's a road  
My feet will (Am) never touch the ground  
And if (Am) you won't give my heart back I've no (C) need to stick (G)
around  
(Am) I miss it  
(C) I miss it  
(G) Oh, I miss that (D) feeling of (C) feeling  
The (D) feeling of (C) feeling  
The (D) feeling of (C) feeling
