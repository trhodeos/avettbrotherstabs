 C              F           Dm                F   
 I ain't from Texas, but I made my way from Dallas
        Dm                 G          C - G     
 and I know the lonesome sound is following
 C           F                    Dm       F
 I ain't a gambler, but I can recognize a hand
              Dm                      G            C - G
 and when to hold, when queens are staring back at me.

 Once I was a carpenter, man my hands were calloused
 I could swing a metal mallet sure and straight
 But I took to the highway, a poet young and hungry
 and I left the timbers where they lay
 
    F                          Fm                       
 Forever I will move like the world that turns beneath me
             C         Am            G
 and when I lose my direction I'll look up to the sky
                F                                
 and when the black cloak drags upon the ground
           Fm                       C
 I'll be ready to surrender, and remember
            Am             G
 well we're all in this together
       F                      Fm
 If I live the life I'm given, I wont be scared to die
 
 
 And I don't come from Detroit, but her diesel motors pull me
 and I followed till I finally lost my way
 And now I spend my days in search of a woman we called purpose
 And if I ever pass back through here town I'll stay
 
 
 Forever I will move like the world that turns beneath me
 and when I lose my direction I'll look up to the sky
 and when the black cloak drags upon the ground
 I'll be ready to surrender, and remember
 well we're all in this together
 If I live the life I'm given, I won't be scared to die
 
 (First riff)
 
 And my life is but a coin, pulled from an empty pocket
 Dropped into a slot with dreams of sevens close behind
 And hope and fear go with it, and moon and the sun go spinning
 Like the numbers and fruits before my eyes
 
 
 C            F         G                C
 Sometimes I hit, sometimes it robs me blind
 Sometimes I hit, sometimes it robs me blind
 
 
 Forever I will move like the world that turns beneath me
 and when I lose my direction I'll look up to the sky
 and when the black cloak drags upon the ground
 I'll be ready to surrender, and remember
 well we're all in this together
 If I live the life I'm given, I won't be scared to die
