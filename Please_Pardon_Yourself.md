As I (G)turn my head to your (C)side of the (G)bed  
Why are you awake whats (C)on your (G)mind  
To this awful news try (C)not to hold (G)on  
Day will come the sun will (C)rise and we'll be (G)fine  
  
As long as I feel as strong as I feel  
I will carry you as long as I can  
As hard on yourself please pardon yourself  
Do the best you can that wont go unseen  
  
How do I know when it's time to (C)stop  
(D)Running from the things I do  
Being things I'm not  
Oh I have (C)tried but I just (G)changed my mind  
Every (D)night that falls (C)every morning (G)light  
  
How do I know that you will never stop  
Knowing me and trusting me  
Loving me a lot  
Oh I have tried but I just changed my mind  
Every night that falls every morning light  
  
(G)There's only so many ways  
You can give your loving to (C)me  
But (D)I'd give my soul for just (G)one of them (C)now  
I'd (D)give up the drinking (G)just tell me (C)how  
  
And there's only so many years  
I can give my loving to you  
But I spent the last one hidden away  
Screaming my lungs out, nothing to say
