# About Love

**Capo III**  
  
I (C)took my last (E7)drink from a (Am)half empty (F)glass  
And (C)laid my tired (E7)bones (Am)out on the (F)grass  
My (C)dad says that (G)all things will (Am)pass (F)  
Well at (C)least he's (G)right about (C)love  
  
My boss is a good man he makes lots of rules  
And he gets so frustrated with all of his tools  
He said, "My God nothing around here works"  
Well at least he's right about love  
Yeah at least he's right about love  
  
I'm laughing so hard my sides start to split  
Well I cannot be told and I will not admit  
That no one else thinks it's a joke  
Well at least I'm right about love  
  
Well I don't trust you or anyone else  
And I don't trust my mind when I'm all by myself  
And I don't trust the look in your eyes  
When you say you're in love  
Yeah when you say you're in love  
  
Since everyone dies and no ones to blame  
My life is a joke, my death is the same  
And every last breath that I draw  
Tells the story of love  
Yeah every last breath that I draw  
Tells the story of love
