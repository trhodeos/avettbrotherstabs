(G) (Em) (C)

G C G

In come the worst of all my thoughts

C G

They changed from gentle and inviting

Em G

Screaming in my ear

C D G

Attracting me and driving me away

  
I was a young man full of fire

With a suitcase and a gun

Each job I pulled would take me higher

But my job stopped being fun

Oh yes, my job stopped being fun

  
He kept adding to the pile

Til the cops came with their cuffs

Now I’ve got to move the money

But I can’t spend it fast enough

No, I can’t spend it fast enough

  
You see there was a kid I used to be

Sometime I changed into this

There was this past that is gone

There is a future it don’t exist

  
In came the worst of all my thoughts

Changed from gentle and inviting

Screaming in my ear

Attracting me and driving me away

  
Now there’s a line of talks a-comin’

Now I gotta shut it down

They tell me you’ve become a big star

But you and I know both know exactly who we are

  
In came the worst of all my thoughts

Changed from gentle and inviting

Screaming in my ear

Attracting me and driving me away

  
I was a young man full of fire

With a suitcase and a gun

Each job I pulled would take me higher

But my job stopped being fun

Oh yes, my job
