# A Gift for Melody Anne

I want to get (D)back  
I want to get (A)square  
I want to get (D)back on the hopes  
and dreams that I have  
that the (A)good Lord above us can (E)spare  
  
(E)I just want my (D)life to (A)true  
just want my heart to be true  
just want my words to be true  
want my soul to feel brand new  
  
I want to hold hands yeah  
Yeah and I want make love  
I want to keep running all day and and all night  
Even when my mind tells my body that's enough  
  
And I want to stand up yeah and I want to stand tall  
If I ever have a son, if I ever have a daughter  
I don't want to tell them that I didn't give my all  
  
And I just want my life to be true  
I just want my heart to be true  
(E)just want my (D)words to be (A)true  
I want my (Bm)soul to feel brand brand new  
like a (D)fresh coat of paint, we can make it anything but (A)blue
anything but (E)blue  
  
Now when your dreams start saying I can't come true  
You'd be better off without me  
Don't let em go, don't let em go  
  
I don't want to go broke, not from one bad deal  
I don't want to be up all night crying in my hands  
For a girl that isn't even real  
  
Lord I just want my life to be true  
And I just want my heart to be true  
And I just want my words to be true  
And I just want my song to be true  
And I just want my heart to be true  
And I just want my life to be true  
And I just want my words to be true  
And I just want my heart to be true  
And I just want my life to be true  
And I just want my song to be true  
And I just want my life to be true  
I want my soul to feel brand new  
I want my soul to feel brand new
