**Capo I**  
  
(C)Salina, I’m as (F)nowhere as (G)I can (C)be  
Could you (F)add some (G)somewhere to (C)me  
Ah (Am)Kansas I’m (F)kneeling, ah (G)Kansas (C)please  
  
Cleveland, I ain’t never felt nothing so strong  
Been believing the words to my songs  
Ohio I’m leaving, Ohio I’m gone  
  
(F)From town to town and state to state  
There’s people everywhere that try to (C)capture us  
(F)We stole the cash and left our names  
And almost slipped in Indiana(C)polis  
The rain it (Am)fell, the story went (C)on  
The rain it (Am)fell, and we got (C)gone (G)  
  
Poughkeepsie, hang up the telephone  
Won’t answer your phone calls no more  
New York quit callin’, New York leave me be  
  
Changing the plans that I’ve been setting on  
I’m scared by the way that my life is getting gone  
Carolina one day I’ll, someday I’ll come home  
Carolina one day I’ll, someday I’ll come home
