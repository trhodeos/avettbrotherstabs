# Pretty Girl From Locust

(G)careful, (D)not to say that I (Em)don't care  
or (C)haven't, or (G)can't, or (Am)will not (D)again  
winter didn't die, she was murdered  
and you are the culprit, I am the saint  
  
(C)it's only (G)right, (Em)it's only (D)right  
for (G)you to (Em)fall, in (D)love with (C)me  
(D)give me a (C)life, (D)give me a (C)life,  
(D)give me (C)tonight, (D)it's only (G)right  
  
thirty days alone, with the savior,  
an angel, a devil, rapture and smoke  
and Iâ€™m careful, just not to say that I miss you  
cause sometimes, I guess I still miss myself  
  
it's only right, it's only right  
for you to fall, in love with me  
give me a life, give me a life  
give me tonight, it's only right
