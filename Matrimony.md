Holy plans and holy gifts, holy shit what did we get?  
You said you've got plans of your own, you're go to work while I stay
home.  
Do you still want my hand?  
Do you still think I'm your man?  
I'll change everything I can.  
Matrimony ...  
My dog is loud and my dog is wild, we're too young to have a child,  
can you keep the dog next week?  
I'll be gone for the next three.  
Do you still want my hand?  
Do you still think I'm your man?  
I'll change everything I can.  
Matrimony ..  
I ain't through I ain't walking out, leaving ain't what I'm about,  
you may scream and I may shout.  
But baby I love you.
