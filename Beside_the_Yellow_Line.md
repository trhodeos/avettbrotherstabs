In time, won't be long  
C  
until we meet again, except we just be friends  
G  
my god yeah I know  
C  
that's just the way it goes out here on the road

beside the yellow line  
  
'Bout five years ago,  
I came about this way, but I doubt they'll know my face  
The land hasn't changed  
The stars still pierce the black, and I'm glad that I came back  
Beside the yellow line  
  
The mind of a girl,  
It's hard to understand, but I guess 'cause I'm a man  
Her heart fears are unknown,  
Until I am gone, gotta leave her all alone  
Beside the yellow line  
  
And the call of the road,  
Unlike the railroad tracks, unlike the airplane path  
Her voice floats, through the land  
and it takes me by the hand, so once again I stand  
Beside the yellow line
