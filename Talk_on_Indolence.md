# Talk on Indolence

Well I’ve been locking myself up in my house for sometime now  
Reading and writing and reading and thinking  
and searching for reasons and missing the seasons  
The Autumn, the Spring, the Summer, the snow  
The record will stop the record will go  
Latches latched the windows down, the dog coming in the dog going out  
Up with caffeine and down with the shot  
Constantly worried about what I’ve got  
Distracting my work but I can’t make a stop and my confidence on and my
confidence off  
And I sink to the bottom and rise to the top  
and I think to myself that I do this a lot  
World outside just goes it goes it goes it goes it goes it goes it goes
it goes it goes  
and witness it all from the blinds of my windows  
  
(G)I'm a little nervous (C)bout what (D)you'll think (G)when you see me
in my (C)swimming (D)trunks and  
(G)last night New York I got (C)raging (D)drunk  
(G)remember one time I got (C)raging (D)drunk with you

Now I can recall a time when we made the city streets our playground  
swimming in the fountain filled with cigarettes and bottles  
sped through Italian city streets of cobblestone  
  
(G)because we had to  
(C)because I loved you  
(G)because the damned alcohol  
because (D)whatever at (G)all  
  
now I've grown to aware of my mortality to let go and froget about dying
long enough to  
drop the hammer down and let the indolence go wild and flying through
