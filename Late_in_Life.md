# Late in Life

She was an actress and a (G)dancer  
a perfect build and careful (C)lines  
i worked the scene to my (Am)advantage  
blackmailed her into being (D)mine  
  
and late in life i left the family  
too old to be considered brave  
to young to make a good decision  
so frozen in my tracks i stay  
  
And in my dreams I saw the future  
as clear as master locks and chains  
that tied the locals to the podiums a  
as they would scream we know you've changed  
  
and late in life i left the family  
too old to be considered brave  
to young to make a good decision  
so frozen in my tracks i stay  
  
just as soon like I met her  
and i knew that it was over  
she was running out the backdoor  
and I was running out the side  
and you know i gotta wonder  
lord if ever i would see her  
ahh maybe when were older  
or maybe when we die  
  
and late in life i left the family  
too old to be considered brave  
to young to make a good decision  
so frozen in my tracks i stay
