(G)She's sweet as the (F)summertime  
(G)strong as the (F)sunshine  
(G)and I don’t want to (F)know her  
(C)I let myself down  
\--same for all verses--  
  
I'm cold as a winter's storm  
soft as a grind stone  
and I can't do a thing  
to flag my life down  
  
chorus:  
(Bm)Why (C)do you (G)amaze me?  
(Bm)Why (C)do you (G)amaze me?  
(Bm)Why (C)do you (G)fool me into (Am)thinking that I'm (C)kind of in
(Cm)love (D7)with (G)you?(F)(G)(F)...  
Big brown eyes and curly hair  
I wonder if she sees me stare  
I can’t say why I’ve fallen  
Babe, please have mercy  
  
Chorus  
  
Ya sleep like a ball and chain  
if I knew more than your first name  
those eyes you got can’t fool me  
I know how this goes  
  
We wrap ourselves in conversation  
You tell lies and try my patience  
Bite my tongue in frustration  
Or you slap my face  
  
on the last line of the last chorus:  
  
...fool me into (Am)thinking that I'm (C)kind of in (Cm)love (D7)with
(C)yoooooouuuuuuououo(G)
