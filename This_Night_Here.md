# This Night Here

**Capo III**  
  
(G)This night here is perfect for (C)getting lost  
(D)Perfect for (C)taking off  
(D)Look at the sky I'm surpised you would ask me,  
to (C)tell you (G)why  
  
This night here is perfect for going wrong  
Trust me I know them well  
I can't remember the last time that I did  
the right thing  
  
This night here is perfect for telling lies  
Look through the devil's eyes  
What do you see when you're looking at me  
Has anything changed?  
  
This night here is perfect for giving up  
Walking from everyone  
Enemy, friend, and all those who pretend that  
They love you  
  
This night here is perfect for getting drunk  
Finding the boats we sunk  
And heading down there just to send up a prayer  
to the living above  
  
This man here should never be listened to  
Don't do what he says to do  
Else you will end up as miserably lost  
as he happens to be  
  
This night here is perfect for trading sins  
You can be what I've been  
Half way between misery and serene nights  
of something like hope
