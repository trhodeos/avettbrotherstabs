# Pretty Girl at the Airport

**Capo II**  
Tabbed by Eric Schwartz  
  
Guitar uses "Travis picking" style (you can google it for more info),
picked mainly on the lower 4 strings.  
  
For example, on G:  

``` 
     |1 Meas.|
     |       |
 e|-------------------------------------|
 A|---------0-------0-------0-------0---|
 D|-----0-------0-------0-------0-------|
 G|-------0-------0-------0-------0-----|
 B|-------------------------------------|
 E|---3-------3-------3-------3---------|
     |                                |
     |<--------- 4 Measures --------->|
```

For this song's tempo, each measure lasts about a second.  
  
Chords and Picking  

-----

  

  - Only one measure of picking shown per chord. Notes in parenthesis
    are accent notes, occasionally replace the note below with the  
    accent note when you feel like it (you can hear it in the
song).  

  

``` 
      G             G*            Am7           C*            G/B           C             Cmin
 e|--------(3)--|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
 A|---------0---|---------0---|--------(0)--|-------------|-------------|---------1---|---------0---|
 D|-----0-------|-----2-------|---------0---|---------0---|---------0---|-----0-------|-----0-------|
 G|-------0-----|-------0-----|-----0-------|-----0-------|-----0-------|-------2-----|-------1-----|
 B|-------------|-------------|-------3-----|-------7-----|-------5-----|---3---------|---3---------|
 E|---3---------|---3---------|---5---------|---8---------|---7---------|-------------|-------------|
```

Sorry for the odd notation, but these aren't the typical formations of
some of these chords.  
  
NOTE: The G\* chord is just a variation on the G, exchange it for the
regular G when you feel like it for a nice accent (you can also  
hear it in the song, esp in the intro)  
  
Verse 1 (Intro similar to Verse)
