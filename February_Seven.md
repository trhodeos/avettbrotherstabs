 C       C/B    C/A        G         F       G 
 I went on the search for something true
 C       C/B    C/A        G         F       G 
 I was almost there when I found you
 C       C/B    C/A      G          
 Sooner then my fate was wrote
   F                   G 
 A perfect blade, it slit my throat
     C       C/B   C/A       G       F       G 
 And beads of lust released into the air
      F       G
 When I awoke you were standing there
 
 
 Break:  C   C/B   C/A   G   F   G    X2 
 
 
 Verse:
 
 C      C/B    C/A       G       F            G 
 I was on the mend when I fell through
     C     C/B      C/A      G   F       G 
 The sky around was anything but blue
 C        C/B    C/A        G         
 I found as I regained my feet
     F               G 
 A wound across my memory
      C   C/B     C/A        G       F         G 
 That no amount of stitches would repair
     F           G
 But I awoke and you were standing there
 
 
 Break:  C  G/B  F  G  X2
 
 
 Chorus:
           C      C/B    C/A   G       F               G 
 There's no fortune at the end of the road that has no end
            C        C/B      C/A           
 There's no returning to the spoils
 G            F                      G 
 Once you've spoiled the thought of them
             C      C/B    C/A          
 There's no falling back asleep
  G          F               G 
 Once you've wakened from the dream
        C      C/B      C/A      G     
 Now I'm rested and I'm ready,
      F             G 
 I'm rested and I'm ready to begin
 
 C      C/B    C/A       G       F         G      
                                        I'm ready to begin
 
 Break:  C  C/B  C/A   G   F    G 
 
 
 
 
 C      C/B    C/A           G       F           G 
 I went on the search for something real
 C       C/B    C/A     G       F                G 
 Traded what I know for how I feel
         C      C/B     C/A      G       
 But the ceiling and the walls collapsed
 F                  G 
 Upon the darkness I was trapped
     C      C/B    C/A           G         F         G 
 And as the last of breath was drawn from me
     F                  G 
 The light broke in and brought me to my feet
 
 
 Break:  C  C/B  C/A   G   F    G 
 
 
 Chorus:
            C      C/B    C/A   G       F               G 
 There's no fortune at the end of the road that has no end
            C        C/B      C/A   
 There's no returning to the spoils
 G           F                      G 
 Once you've spoiled the thought of them
            C      C/B    C/A          
 There's no falling back asleep
  G          F               G 
 Once you've wakened from the dream
        C      C/B      C/A      G       
 Now I'm rested and I'm ready,
         F                G 
 I'm rested and I'm ready
        C      C/B      C/A      G     
 Yeah I'm rested and I'm ready
     F              G 
 I'm rested and I'm ready
         C      C/B      C/A     G   
 Yeah I'm rested and I'm ready
     F             G 
 I'm rested and I'm ready
