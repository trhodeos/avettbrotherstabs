# Sorry Man

Your (C)momma (G)doesn't (C)like me, she thinks I'm a (C)so (G)rry
(F)man  
when she tells her friends about me, she says I'm a sorry man  
And she asks you each day, why would you stay with a sorry man  
Well I was doin' my best, just to impress, still a sorry man  
  
But (G)I've got (C)news for your (F)mom  
I'm the (G)best she (C)ever (F)saw  
(G)No one could (C)love her (F)daught (G)er like I (C)do  
  
your momma told your father, she I'm a sorry man  
so he told me not to ever, come back here again  
so I told your dear old daddy, that he could not keep us apart  
Because it's you and not your parents, who can break my heart  
  
But I've got news for your parents, I'm the best she ever saw  
no one could love your daughter like I do  
  
Well I tried to tell your mother, but I did not want to fight  
Will they be the same tomorrow, so we're leaving here tonight  
Tomorrow they'll be waking, to a sad sorry dawn  
And then they'll be sorry, when they see that your gone
