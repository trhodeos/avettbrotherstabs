# The Mourning, The Silver, The Bell

**Capo III**  
  
Do you (G)know me? Well (C)I know (D)you  
(G)Just like I know the (C)sun is (D)blue  
The (Em)grass is orange and the (Am)sky is green  
and a (G)woman's heart runs on (C)gaso(D)line  
  
Did you see me? Well I saw you  
So late at night that the day was new  
And after taking a heavy dose  
And the funny thing is my eyes were closed  
  
(Am)Wrong as the (G)day is (C)long  
As her (Am)light (G)swears (C)on  
As her (Am)"love (G)you" (C)song  
Sings to (D)me  
  
When I'm quiet I hear you call  
Whispering words I don't know at all  
But if I move closer so I can hear  
I know your voice might just disappear  
  
Wrong as the day is long  
As her light stays on  
As her "love you" song  
Sings at me  
  
I'm the (G)mourning  
I'm the (Am)aching  
I'm the (C)color  
I'm the (D)fading  
I'm the under  
I'm the saving  
I'm the silver  
I'm the bell  
  
Do I know you? Well you know me  
Just like you know one and one makes three  
And snow flakes fall in the summer breeze  
And your money grows from the apple trees  
  
Is this over? Well you tell me  
I heard that love lasts eternally  
But when I reach over to touch your hair  
I realize that there's noone there  
  
Wrong as the day is long  
As her light swears on  
As her "love you" song  
Sings to me  
  
I'm the mourning  
I'm the aching  
I'm the cover  
I'm the taking  
I'm the lover  
I'm the killer  
I could love her  
I could kill her  
I'm the keeping  
I'm the sending  
I'm the sleeping  
I'm the bending  
I'm the only  
I'm the waiting  
I'm the knowing  
I'm the shaking  
I'm the hoping  
I'm the changing  
I'm the falling  
I'm the breaking  
I'm the color  
I'm the fading  
I'm the silver  
I'm the bell  
I'm the mourning
