# The Lowering: A Sad Day in Greenville Town

**Capo 7** (yes, seven)

(G)If I had known, your (Bm)heart was down
that (C)lonely day in (D)Greenville town,
(G)Then I would have been (Bm)more concerned
but (C)later on I (D)truly learned
how (G)it can feel in (Bm)every bone
to (C)really see you're (D)all alone

But (Em)I'll (C)kiss your (G)head,
when (Em)death (C)finds your (G)bed
and you are (C)gone

And if I had seen
the way it would be
I'd hushed your cries
when you came to me
If I could do what I did to you
the same to me then I would love for you to see
that I sleep with remorse
and regret hangs round my door
for ever more.

If I had known the lowering tide,
was lowering with the way you felt inside
if I had known all hope was gone
a broken heart and a broken home
That pierced, my lover's past
and carved a lonely path...
for her to walk

So if ever someone one says to you,
life isn't fair, get used to it
Then you should say 'Well it might be;
If folks like you would let it be'

but Iâ€™ll kiss your head
when death becomes my bed
and I am gone
