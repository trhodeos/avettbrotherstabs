# Brakelights Part 2 Cheap Rum

I don't (C)see your (Am)brakelights (Dm)burnin'
Well I (G)don't guess your (F)turnin' (C)around
You wave (C)back but (Am)now your (Dm)engine is
(G)just a (F)fading (C)sound

I was (G)wrong when (F)I was (C)thinking
That (G)I'd (F)survive the (C)storm
And I was (G)wrong when (F)I was (C)thinking
That (G)I could (F)keep you (C)warm

I don't see your brakelights burnin'
Well I don't guess your turnin' around
You wave back but now you engine
is just a fading sound
Oh it's just a fading sound

There's (Am)one way to (C)live and (G)one way to (C)die
I (Am)ask you to (C)give, you (G)tell me (C)goodbye
A (Am)short wave of (C)guilt (G)keeps you in (C)line
It (Am)changes your (C)heart, it (G)changes your (C)mind

This is (G)not what (F)I was (C)hoping
To lose before the spring
It's time to leave the rocker no one ever sees

I don't see your brakelights burnin'
Well I don't guess your turnin' around
You wave back but now you engine
is just a fading sound
Oh it's just a fading sound
Oh it's just a fading sound
