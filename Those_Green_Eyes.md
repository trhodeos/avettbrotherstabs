# Those Green Eyes

Those green (G)eyes, that black (D)hair,  
Made me a (G)sucker, standing (D)there,  
At the (G)remains of a (G7)high school (C)football game,  
And it don't (G)do me any (D)good to remember (G)you.  

In a world of tuxedos and red sequins,  
The jealous girl said "that's an ugly dress,"  
But that dress sure did the trick for me,  
The picture in my mind is never hard to see.  

Fire in the sky, fourth of July,  
My heart turned cold as I watched her cry.  
In her despair I nearly lost my mind,  
It's like we started over a hundred thousand times.  

But those green eyes, that pass me by.  
I could not make her mine however hard I tried.  
And I am lonely now, but I've got my memory  
Those green eyes and that black hair, they set me free.
