(Em)Who are my (C) friends anyway (G)

(Em)Are these really words of a (C)young man or a (G)worthless human
life

(Em)You made it clear (C) that nothing stays the same(G)  
It's getting darker I (C)wonder if you can tell (G)  
(Em)I wonder when did (C)all that change? (G)  

You never used to let me go unfed  
I was so distracted I never saw the rain  
You promised you meant every word you said  
I wonder when all that changed  
It hurts so bad to hear such pretty words coming from somebody like
you  
I've been looking for so long that I've lost touch  
With what's the best something to do  
I've got a friend who makes good choices  
Everybody likes the way that he sees things  
I've got a problem and it walks me daily  
Can't you see no one is proud of me  
It's a long road alone and I'm not proving  
Anything going by myself  
When your love life is on and really moving  
Oh sugar girl I really appreciate the help  

I had my time with money gold and diamonds  
Both went sour before they got to me  
I'll be waiting girl but don't be counting hours  
I'm not waiting for any of the three  
I was just a peasant from the highlands  
She said don't you call me your mountain girl  
I said don't bother me I'm trying to write and  
don't worry you ain't my mountain girl  
I can call you but I'd probably make you cry  
These days it's what you often times do  
Call the preacher then go call your father  
Tell them that the wedding plans have moved  
I send a message saying I'll be gone forever  
The letter of reply never came  
She said that she'd be true but I wouldn't let her  
I wonder when all that changed  

Hell has no fury like a woman  
Happy scorned or otherwise  
You can do what you want to with your name  
But you can bet I'm changing mine  
Well I'd give a $100 to get a letter  
If at the bottom it said I miss you bad  
See but the truth of the matter is that back home no one really misses
me  
See how I talk when I'm sad  
Since I was young I've known a lot of women...
