Guitar \#1 – no capo - D, C, G  
Guitar \#2 – capo 5 - A, G, D  

Intro D, C, G x4  

Ten (D)thousand words swarm (C)round my head, Ten (G)million more in
books written be(D)neath my bed. C G  
I (D)wrote or read them (C)all when searching (G)in the swarm still
can't find out how to (D)hold my hands. C G  
And I (D)know ya need me (C)in the next room (G)over, but I am stuck in
here all (D)paralyzed. C G  
For (D)months I got my(C)self in ruts, too much (G)time spent in mirrors
framed in (D)yellow walls. C G  

  

(D)Ain't it like most (C)people, I'm no (G)different, we love to talk on
things we don't (D)know about. C G x2  

  

And everyone around me shakes their head in disbelief and says I'm too
caught up.  
They say young is good and old is fine and truth is cool, but all that
matters is you had your good times.  
But those good times come with prices and I can't believe it when I hear
the jokes they make.  
At anyone's expense except their own, would they laugh if they knew who
paid?  

  
(D)Ain't it like most (C)people, I'm no (G)different, we love to talk on
things we don't (D)know about. C G x2  

  
interlude  

  
And after we are through, ten years in making it to be the most of
glorious debuts.  
I'll come back home without my things cause the clothes I wore out there
I will not wear round you.  
And they'll be quick to point out our shortcomings, and how the experts
all have had their doubts.
