# Another Is Waiting

It's a (G)fake, it's a (Em)hoax  
It's a (Bm)nowhere road where (D)no one goes  
(G)Anywhere, (Em)anyhow  
Well you're (Bm)following your (D)heart rate (C)down  
  

She's a rose, she's a queen  
But she's staring at a magazine  
In the dark, on that path  
Where they doctor every photograph  
  

(C)Another is (G)waiting  
(C)She isn't (G)saying (D)anything(C)  
  

If you care, if you like  
Well, I'm standing in the lantern light  
With our weapons and our love  
And I use them both to cover up  
  

\[Chorus\]  
  

But I (Em)love you and I (Bm)care  
So you've (C)got to get off that conveyor belt  
If I (Em)could  
I would (BM)come right in (C)and take you off (D)myself  
  

It's a fake, it's a con  
The nature of the road you're on  
Let me see your skeleton  
Well before your life is done  
  

\[Chorus x2\]
