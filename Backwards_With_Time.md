**Capo II**  
(C)Folk always (F)told me that (C)my heart would (G)grow  
the (C)older the (F)man yeah the (C)stronger the (G)stone  
(Am)am (G)I (F)losing my (C)mind  
am (C)I growing (F)backwards with (C)time  
  
Some say with age that our purpose comes clear  
I see the opposite happening here  
Are we losing the fight  
are we growing backwards with time  
  
(Am)I was (G)young and (F)love was (C)fun  
now it's so (G)seri(C)ous  
(Am)now all the (G)fun has (F)equal (C)pain theres something (G)wrong
with (C)this  
For all I know theres more I dont  
oh the little I have learned  
for every year of knowledge gained  
is a negative year I've earned  
  
Folk always told me that my heart would grow  
The older the man, yeah, the stronger the stone  
Am I losing my mind?
