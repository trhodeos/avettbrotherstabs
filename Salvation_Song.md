# Salvation Song

(G)If you take my heart  
(C)Don't leave the smallest part  
(D)I've no need to live  
If you're to come up (G)gone  
  
As my life turns to a song  
And if and when I treat you wrong  
No I never want to hurt  
Our family  
  
I would give up everything  
No this is not just about me  
And I don't know a plainer way  
To say it Babe  
  
And they may pay us off in fame  
Thought that is not why we came  
And I know well and good  
That won't heal our hearts  
  
We came for (C)salvation  
We came for (G)family  
We came for (D)all that's good  
That's how we'll (C)walk (G)away  
  
We came to break the bad  
We came to cheer the sad  
We came to leave behind  
The world a better way  
  
Now if I'm walking through the rain  
And I hear you call me name  
I will break into a run  
Without a pause  
  
And if your love laughs at your dreams  
It's not as bad as it seems  
Either way  
One of them has got to go  
  
And if you take of my soul  
You can still leave it whole  
With the pieces of you own  
You leave behind  
  
We came for salvation  
We came for family  
We came for all that's good  
That's how we'll walk away  
  
We came to break the bad  
We came to cheer the sad  
We came to leave behind  
The world a better way  
  
I would give up everything  
If you were to come up clean  
And see you shine so bright  
In a world of woe  
  
And they may pay us off in fame  
But that is not why we came  
And if it compromises truth  
Then we will go  
  
We came for salvation  
We came for family  
We came for all that's good  
That's how we'll walk away  
  
We came to break the bad  
We came to cheer the sad  
We came to leave behind  
The world a better way
