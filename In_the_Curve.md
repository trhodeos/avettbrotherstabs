(G)I've never (D)taken this (G)curve  
(G)driving this (D)fast (G)before  
(G)A glowing stop (D)sign but (Em)both lanes are (C)mine  
no (G)seat belts (D)attached to my (G)door  
  
Well my speed meter don't work  
so I'm going to guess 95  
maybe I'll fix it, and maybe I won't  
It depends on my being alive  
  
my bottle of bourbon is gone  
It flew away all by itself  
So if ever you find it, my photo behind it  
In memory of me on your shelf  
  
its been raining all day  
and its been raining all night  
A slip and slide highway  
and I'm moving sideways  
I'm loose but my steering wheel's tight  
  
My '63 Ford is a bull  
She's four thousand pounds at least  
But metal surrenders when Oak trees meet fenders  
and engines go through the front seat  
  
I lost control in the curve  
the gas line broke in the wreck  
But I rose from the ashes with just a few scratches  
my crucifix warm on my neck  
  
Well the good Lord was with me tonight  
Just riding beside me tonight  
And now we're just talking  
We're hitchhiking walking  
We'll see you in Greenville tonight  

And now we're just talking we're hitchhiking walking We'll see you in
Greenville tonight
