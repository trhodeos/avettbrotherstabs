# Colorshow

(Am)Be loud let your (F)colors show  
(Am)try to keep the madness (F)low  
if they (Am)hear and its wrong  
and they (F)come with torches on(Am)  
yeah come on  
  
Be loud let your colors show  
Try to keep the madness low  
I tell them no with my hand  
Make them understand the plan of it  
Bright and gone  
  
And I'm (C)done (Am)forever  
its (F)you and me (G)forever  
Cause I'm (C)done (Am)forever  
its (F)you and me (G)forever  
  
Be loud let the others know  
First a whisper then it grows  
I tell them go with my hands  
Make them understand the last of it  
Yeah come on, pain and all  
  
Leave out pack your things and go  
Leave the baby makers home  
There's a time (now) and a place (now)  
Someone built to take the race  
When it calls you go head down  
  
Head down don't you make a sound  
Keep your plans all to yourself  
They'll come true they follow you  
They're what you're obligated to  
Don't you listen to nobody else  
  
And I'm done forever  
It's you and me forever  
Cause I'm done forever  
See it's you and me forever
