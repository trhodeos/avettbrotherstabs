# And It Spread

**Capo II**  
  
Intro, (preferably barred):  
(Em)(C)(G)(D)  
(C)(D7)(G)  
  
(C)There was (D7)light in the (G)room  
(C)Then you (D7)left and it was (G)through  
Then the frost started in  
My toes and fingertips  
  
(B7)And it (C)spread  
(B7)And it (C)spread  
Into my (G)heart  
And it spread  
And it spread  
Into my heart  
  
Then for I don't know how long  
I settled in to do it wrong  
And as the wind fills the sail  
Came the fog to hurt myself  
  
And it spread  
And it spread  
Into my home  
And it spread  
And it spread  
Into my song  
(C)where (D)there (Em)are (C)no (G)lines  
(D)sepa(Em)ra(C)ting (G)the (Bm7)truth from the (C)lies(D)(G)  
  
Then you came back from space  
With a brand new laugh  
And a different face  
You took my hand and held it up  
And shot my arm full of love  
  
And it spread  
And it spread  
Into the world  
And it spread  
And it spread  
Into the world  
  
Where there are no lines  
Separating the truth from lies
