Well it's (G)been a pretty rough  
(Gmaj7)couple of years but I (Em)think things  
will change for (C)us  
(G)And I always will put you (Gmaj7)before me  
(Em)Unless, of course, it's (C)dangerous  
  
(G)Standing with you  
(Gmaj7)Standing with you  
(Em)I might miss the rhythm  
But I'm (C)catching the tune  
And that's (Em)pretty (D)good for (G)me  
  
Well I told you I wont make the same mistakes again  
But you know I probably will  
And so many nights go by like a flash  
Like a camera without any film  
But we don't need to remember every single moment we've had  
And I don't need understanding for every single moment I've had  
  
No  
As long as I'm  
  
Standing with you  
standing with you  
I might miss the rhythm  
But I'm catching the tune  
And that's something for me  
Standing with you  
Standing with you  
I might miss the meaning  
But I'm catching the truth  
And that's pretty good for me  
  
Well it's (G)been a pretty rough (Em)couple of years  
But I (C)think things will (D)change for (G)us
