# Go to Sleep

(G)Lay back, lay back, go to sleep my (C)man  
(G)Wipe the blood from you face and your (C)hands  
(G)Forgive yourself if you think that you (C)can  
(G)Go to sleep, (D)go to sleep my (C)man  
  
Twenty-one days lost at sea I fought  
For twenty-two years non-stop I've talked  
Through the desert, pissed drunk, and confused I walked  
I spit a tooth in the palm of my hand  
  
Lay back, lay back, go to sleep my man  
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands  
Forgive yourself if you think that you can  
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man  
  
Well the wind and the trees are ganging up on me  
They sing my funeral song in harmony  
Well I just want to walk home on the drunk I need  
But they keep singing and singing and singing to me...  
La, La, La, La, La, La (I hear them singing)  
La, La, La, La, La, La (Singing for me)  
La, La, La, La, La, La (Oh\!)  
  
Well I wish things were different, true, and deep  
But everything that's so shallow is everything about me  
If only I could just take all my money and leave  
I hope the people on the ground will understand  
I hope the people out there will understand  
  
Lay back, lay back, go to sleep my man  
Wipe the blood from you face and your hands  
Forgive yourself if you think that you can  
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man  
La, La  
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man  
La, La  
Go to sleep, go to sleep my man
