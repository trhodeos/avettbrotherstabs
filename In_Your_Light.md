# In Your Light

**Capo 2**  
  
(D)  
In your (G)light girl, in your (D)light  
In your (Bm)light girl, in your (E)light  
I could (G)turn into a (D)window sill,  
a (G)daffodil or (D)caterpillar  
In your (G)light (D)  
  
In your room girl, in your room  
In your room girl, in your room  
I could face all of my memories,  
and tell them not to bother me  
In your room  
  
I could (C)be (G)anything  
I could (C)be almost (G)anything (D)  
  
In your town girl, in your town  
In your town girl, in your town  
When your neighborhood says, "Who are you?"  
I tell them "I ain't no stranger I ain't just passin' through"  
In your town  
  
I walk your lane girl, I walk your lane  
I walk your lane girl, I walk your lane  
With a handful of dandelions,  
and a belly full of apple wine  
On your lane  
  
In your arms girl, in your arms  
In your arms girl, in your arms  
I could change my name to harmony,  
then change it back to misery  
In your arms  
  
And in your life girl, in your life  
In your life girl, in your life  
I could be the one you love the best  
Forsake your past and love me for the rest of your life  
  
I could be anything  
I could be almost anything
