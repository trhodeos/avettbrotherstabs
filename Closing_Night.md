Repeat Intro (x1)

And poetic justice burns in the minds  
Of five dying soldiers on the front lines  
With nobody's singing in nobody's ears  
No one's disappointed, nobody hears  

I know a lady, promise her name  
The price of her visit suffering and pain  
And we gladly waited and we gladly paid  
We watched the sun rise, she never came  

An electric current moves us around  
We sank to our knees to worship the sound  
But nobody told us that we'd rise again  
Imagine a hero unable to win  

Imagine a hero unable to win
