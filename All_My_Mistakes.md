I have some "friends" they don't know who I am  
So I write quotations around the word friends  
But I have a couple that have always been there for me  
  
And I missed some fun 'cause I worked through the dawn  
Expecting your praise when I returned home  
But I paid the cost 'cause I got left alone for the songs  
  
But I can't go back  
And I don't want to  
'Cause all my mistakes  
They brought me to you
