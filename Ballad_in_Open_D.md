# Ballad in Open D

This song is played in Open D tuning (duh).  
  
Loneliness is not something that I'm used to  
Loneliness is not something that I'm used to  
But sleeping well is just something that I used to do  
And making love is just something that I used to do  
  
Well I tried to fill my empty nights with drinking  
I'm going to keep on trying to fill them up with drinking  
Anything to keep my boat from sinking  
Anything to keep my head from thinking  
  
Well there might be something  
she wants for me to give her  
Lord, there might be something  
she wants for me to give her  
Like maybe some clothes or jewlery that she left here  
Well I'd give her things back gladly,  
but I can't cause I threw them in a river  
  
I keep my windows open in the summer  
And I keep my windows open in the spring time  
And I keep my windows open in the winter  
I'm going ot keep my doorway open come this Autumn  
  
Well you weren't suprised when I told you I was dying  
You laughed and said well darling who isn't  
Well theres got to be something that I'm missing  
Well it's hard to keep your vision  
When you heart treats your memory like a prison  
  
Well I've had to teach myself not to adore ya  
But I've had to teach myself not to adore ya  
Cause everything has changed since the morning  
That we awoke and left the mountains of California
