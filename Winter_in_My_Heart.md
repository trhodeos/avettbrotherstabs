# Winter in My Heart

``` 
 A
 It must be Winter in my heart,
 A                                C#m
 There's nothing warm in there at all.
 C#m                             Bm
 I've missed the Summer and the Spring,
 D                             A
 The floating yellow leaves of fall.
 
 A
 A million colors fill my eyes,
                            C#m
 The roman candles and the stars.
 C#m                Bm
 calendar says July Fourth,
 D                           A
 But it's still Winter in my heart.
 
 A        C#m     D         A
 they say flowers bloom in spring,
 F#m     A        D        E
 Red and gold and blue and pink.
 A         C#m     D      A
 They say seasons turn in time,
 F#m        A        D         E
 theirs are changing why won't mine.
                         A
 It must be winter in my heart,
 A                                C#m

 C#m                            Bm
 I've missed the Summer and the Spring,
 D                              A
 The floating yellow leaves of fall.
 
 A
 The air in there is frigid cold,
 A                             C#m
 I don't know what the reasons are.
 C#m                  Bm
 Calendar says August One,
 D                           A
 But it's still Winter in My Heart.
