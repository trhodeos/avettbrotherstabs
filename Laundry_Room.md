(G)Just a little longer  
(C)Stall your mother disregard your father's (G)wooooo(G/C)oooords(G)  
  
Close the Laundry door  
Tiptoe across the floor  
Keep your clothes on I've got all that I can take  
Teach me how to use the love that people say you make  
  
Stop your parents car  
I just saw a shooting star  
We can wish upon it. We wont share the wish we made  
But I cant keep no secrets I wish that you would always stay  
  
Last night I dreamt the whole night long  
I woke with a head full of songs  
I spent the whole day  
I wrote 'em down but its a shame  
tonight I'll burn the lyrics  
cause every chorus was your name  
  
Break this tired old routine  
And this time dont make me leave  
I am a breathing time machine  
I'll take you all for a ride
