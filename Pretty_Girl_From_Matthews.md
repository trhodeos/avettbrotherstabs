# Pretty Girl From Matthews

(G)Hold on a minute, it ain't (C)time to leave  
(C)Tell me how you're feeling one more (G)time  
(G)Four long years, and I just (C)can't believe  
(C)That I'm still yours and you're still (G)mine  
  
While I was gone, yes I, fell in love  
Asked around and heard that you did too  
Two drunken years, and push came to  
shove I met love, love left me blue  
  
(D)You're (C)rising like a (G)sun  
(D)That pulled the (C)curtain on the (G)night  
(D)Coming (C)through the (G)window  
(D)To (C)brighten up my (G)life  
  
And I'm all right, yeah, I think I'm fine  
My savior lives in telephones  
And I just dream of you, and step outside  
Dial up and hope that you're at home  
  
You're rising like a sun  
That waits up all night  
Coming through the window  
To brighten up my life  
  
Hold on a minute, yeah, I do love you  
Sometimes I guess that ain't enough  
When you come round you put me through  
And I thank you, oh, so much  
Another year, maybe, three or four  
Maybe five or six, or even more  
You'll find another man to take my place  
And I'll see you on the good Lord's shores  
  
You're rising like a sun  
That pulled the curtain on the night  
Coming through the window  
To brighten up my life
