# Black, Blue

**Capo 5, 1/2 step down**  
  
G G/F\# Em C (x2)  
  
G G/F\# Em C  
Nobody will call  
G G/F\# Em C  
Not as long as I keep my phone off the line  
G G/F\# Em C G G/F\# Em C  
not as long as I keep my voice down inside of my mouth  
G G/F\# Em C  
But it's getting harder to hide  
G G/F\# Em C  
And the brightness of the colors makes it hard to describe  
G G/F\# Em C  
And the voices that seem to come from all sides  
G G/F\# Em C  
Makes it hard to decide  
  
Em C G D C  
Black, Blue, Her, You  
  
G G/F\# Em C  
I know a woman who said  
G G/F\# Em C  
'Oh if I could only just turn back the clock  
G G/F\# Em C  
When I was still scared and my hair was still dark  
G G/F\# Em C  
And my hands were clean  
G G/F\# Em C  
But now all my choices are spent  
G G/F\# Em C  
And the men that I've known they don't know what I meant  
G G/F\# Em C  
And cupid's arrow is backwards and bent  
G G/F\# Em C  
When it's flying for me  
  
Em C G D Em C G D C  
Black, Blue, Her, You, White, Green, Him, Me  
  
G G/F\# Em C  
Nobody will say  
G G/F\# Em C  
Oh what a fine young upstanding man  
G G/F\# Em C  
With his ducks in a row and his 50 year plan  
G G/F\# Em C  
Complete with an ending  
G G/F\# Em C  
But it's getting harder to see  
G G/F\# Em C  
And the time between daylight seems longer to me  
G G/F\# Em C  
And the person I am and the person I'll be  
G G/F\# Em C  
Refuse to meet  
  
Em C G D Em C G D C  
Black, Blue, Her, You, White, Green, Him, Me
