(G)November came and went like a (C)summer that I spent  
(D)with a no name girl that walked in jelly (G)shoes  
I returned to my home with a heart part made of stone  
and I cried all night for a girl I never knew...  
From the east it comes, her love and the rising sun  
and I pray each time they come, it's not the last...  
You see I've got strong, I made it through what comes along,  
but I can't move on for the beauty of the past...  
  
Came across a pretty girl, for about a month she was my world  
and I held her hand, and swore we'd never part...  
I moved on, she stayed behind, I said I'd call, she said she'd
write...  
we lost touch the moment I drove off...  
I left town like a gambler with the sense to cash in all the chips  
before I lost them all on a bad deal...  
I made believe I was in a race drove ten thousand miles in seven days  
while writing a book called "Being A Free Man"...  
Met more people than the president, the good times came and the good
times went,  
and I learned how to ignore my hunger pangs...  
I looked ahead to the open road, thought about the people and what they
know  
and wrote a book called "People Don't Know Nothing" (no matter what they
tell ya)...  
  
Once I spent my last dime, and counted the ratio of miles to time,  
I looked up to my disdain and my surprise...  
I had drive my car around the world, ended back in the town with the
girl,  
so I wrote a book called "Live in Prison (volume. 1)"...  
I see that girl every now and then and we drink to having such good time
friends  
and apologize for the way it did not last...  
Funny thing that its all true and I'll always love November Blue,  
but I turned her down for the beauty of the past
