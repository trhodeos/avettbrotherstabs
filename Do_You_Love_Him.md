# Do You Love Him

Do you (G)love him, do you love him, do you love him my (D)dear  
Does he hold you, does he hug you, does he keep you (G)near  
as you lie together does he whisper in your (C)ear  
  
Do you (G)love him, do you love him, do you (C)love him (D)my (G)dear  
  
In the evening, those tired evenings, in twilights first glare  
does he lay in your lap, do you play with your hair  
and as he falls asleep, do you just stare  
  
Do you love him, do you love him, do you love him my dear  

Late in the night when you fear the unknown  
Does he warm up your mind? As you chill to the bone  
  
I do love you, I do feel you, Each day and night  
But I can't tell right from wrong, or fear from insight  
But you always knew everything and that is what is clear  
  
Do you love him? Do you love him? Do you love him, my dear?
