# Vanity

``` 
 C        Am           F
 I've got something to say
          C       Am       G       F
 But it's all vanity, it's all vanity
 C         Am           F
 I found a tune I could play
          C       Am       G       F
 But it's all vanity, it's all vanity
 
 
 G            C
 Call off the guards
 G            C
 Call off the search
       G                 C
 Their heads are chopped off
         G         Am
 They're running in circles
         F          G
 They're running in circles
 
 
 C        Am           F
 I have a plan for the day 
          C       Am       G       F
 But it's all vanity, it's all vanity
          C            Am        F
 I've got love pouring out of my veins
          C      Am        G       F
 But it's all vanity, it's all vanity
 
 
 G            C
 Call off the guards
 G            C
 Call off the search
       G                 C
 Their heads are chopped off
         G         Am
 They're running in circles
       F          G
 They're running in circles
         G         Am
 They're running in circles
         F          G
 They're running in circles
