 G                      C         G               Em
 Well your hair fell on me like I dreamt that it would
        C           D        G
 When I dreamt your hair was long
 G                      C          G              Em
 Through the linens a moment of clearness shown through
       C           D          G
 In a minute the clearness was gone
 
 G                    C              G        Em
 When to know what I should for my heart to rest
          C              D         G
 Doesn't meet with the actions I make
 G                  C            G      Em
 I will seek the approval of no one but you
      C            D         G 
 In love for the changes I take
 
 
 
 Em                 C
 The first time we fell for it
 G                Em
 We blamed it on youth
 Em               C
 And now we get hell for it
 G                Em
 And blame it on truth
 
 C           G
 Of mind, oh my
 C           G
 Of mind, oh my
 C           G
 Of mind, oh my
