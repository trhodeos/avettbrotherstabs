# Pretty Girl from Cedar Lane

(G)I had a (B7)moment when I (C)thought I might be (D)wrong  
But (G)Ashley (B7)how could it (C)be (D)  
(G)I waited on the (B7)rooftop (C)all night (D)long  
But (G)you weren't (B7)coming for (C)me (D)  
  
(B7)And now I'm sitting here like a (C)mixed up little kid  
(B7)You said you wanted me but (C)you never (D)did  
(G)There was a (B7)moment when I (C)thought our love was (D)strong  
(G)But now that (C)moment is (G)gone  
  
I could stand right underneath the window of your room  
Throwing rocks I've done it before  
And I would love to find a reason  
To dazzle you with lies  
But I don't have the energy no more  
  
And you never promise anything you didn't give  
I assumed that you'd say yes but you never did  
There was a moment my love for you was strong  
But now that moment is gone  
Now that moment is gone  
(C)I saw you behind the camera whispering to your friends  
And watching me (G)(C)(G)(C)(G)  
(C)I fell in love with you there  
Which proves the fool that I can often (G)be  
(G)(C)(G)(C)(G)Oooooooooh-ooooooooh yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa (4x)  
Woooooooooooooooooooooh  
  
But I had a moment that I thought I might be right  
But Ashley how could it be  
I drank your share bourbon thinking you might come around  
There ain't no one on the rooftop but me  
  
And now I'm sitting here like a mixed up little kid  
You said you wanted me but you never did  
There was a moment my love for you was strong  
But Ashley that moment is gone  
(Yea) Ashley that moment is gone  
Now that moment is gone
