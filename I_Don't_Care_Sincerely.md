# I Don't Care Sincerely

(Bb)Don't write me (F)back  
(Bb)Don't write me (F)back  
(Bb)I can't re(F)act the way you (C)want  
(Bb)Don't call my (F)phone  
(Bb)I'm not at (F)home  
(Bb)Your voice is just a (F)static moan to (C)me  
And it's (C)on and (F)on  
(C)I go (F)alone  
(Bb)You say it's (F)wrong to be in (C)love  
  
The end's plain to see  
So I left your keys  
Taped to your door with a note  
It said,"If you  
have something to  
say to me you better say it soon, sincerely.  
You know it's me."  
What will you do without my love?  
I am in a place that feels so natural and wrong  
  
Don't call my name  
No don't call my name  
You make it sound as if it hurts  
And keep all your words  
Theres three that I heard  
Whether or not you said 'em out loud  
They were "I don't care"  
So there  
Good luck with the rest of your life
