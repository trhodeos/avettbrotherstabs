# The Traveling Song

Well I (E)guess if my daddy hadn't brought me up down a long dirt road
in a pickup truck  
well I'd (A)feel alright, in the city (E)lights  
couldn't (B7)lead no city (A)life it just ain't (E)right  
  
I was born out west in Cheyenne-town while my ma and pa was ramblin'
around  
I'm a rambler too, and I'm country bound  
I will travel til my country home is found  
  
I will (A)travel  
I will (E)travel  
(B7)I will travel til my (A)country home is (E)found  
  
A country song on the radio, country song what do you know  
he's a city boy singin country tune, i'm a country boy with those city
blues  
  
So I will travel  
I will travel  
I will travel til my country home is found  
  
Well (A)Chestertown, (lets go), (E)somerville, (lets go), (B7)shelby
(lets go)...(A)(E)(A)  
  
I've got the wheels to ride and the wheels to run,  
some say I've got ramblin' in my blood  
no purtty girl can slow me down  
I'm travelin' till my country home is found  
  
So I will travel  
I will travel  
I will travel til my country home is found
