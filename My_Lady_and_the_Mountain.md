# My Lady and the Mountain

  
**Capo I**  

(D)I brought you to the (G)river  
(D)to watch the fish swim (G)by  
and lay around that grassy bank  
and breathe in that blue sky  
i brought you to these waters  
to see what you could see  
the difference in the two worlds  
cant help but frighten me  
cause (E7)darlin' its been a (D)long time  
(Bm) since ive seen you (A7))smile that way at (D)me  
(E7)darling just feel the (D)warmth here, (Bm) happy's not the (A7)
word, you make me (D)free  
  

i brought you to the mountains  
to watch the clouds float by  
the wind here gives me shivers and the freedom makes me cry  
and being with you darling  
forget what we have not  
just being at the top here  
can convince anyone theres a god  
cause darling its been forever since ive seen you smile that way at me  
darling just feel the warmth here, happys not the word, you make me
free  
  
make me free now  
  

i gave you my decision  
regardless wrong or right  
the hills they make me feel good  
they make me feel alive  
like singing with my family on a sunday afternoon  
like laughing in the morning wrapped up tight with you  
but darling its been a long time since ive seen you smile that way at
me  
darling just feel the warth here, happys not the word, you make me
free  
no no happys not the word you make me free  
no no happys not the word you make me free
