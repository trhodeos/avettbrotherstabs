# Old Wyom

A  
Well I dreamed of how our life would be, oh yeah  
E  
Lovin' and a-kissin' 'neath an old oak tree, uh huh  
Bm C\#m D\#m D  
I'd be singing you a song that was twenty lines long  
A E A  
and catching sweet kisses you blow way out in Wyom  
  
I work my day to come home to you, oh yeah  
So you can do whatever you wanna do, uh huh  
With your big brown eyes and your curly brown hair,  
I'm doing the best I can do just to try to not stare  
  
E D A  
My God, your loveliness  
  
Gotta feelin your man he won't like the news, oh no  
Ain't gonna like it when he has to choose, oh no  
With you could be one and never be apart (?)  
I can feel it in my mind I can feel it in my soul in my heart  
  
Bm D A  
Oh baby please come around  
  
Was that your man he's your fianc√©, oh yeah  
The one to tie the knot each and every day uh huh  
I gotta get up the nerve to pick up the phone  
It's you sweet mama I'm-a gonna carry you back home\!  
  
E D A  
Way out to old Wyom  
  
I prob'ly shoulda thought about lettin' you know, uh huh  
If I love you like I do I shoulda told you so, uh huh  
Well I think about you each and every day,  
It's just my knees are gettin' weak when I try to say  
  
Bm D A  
Oh baby, please be mine  
  
Gotta feelin' that I'm barkin' up and empty tree  
How could someone so beautiful think about me?  
Put my tail between my legs and turn my back  
Try on my trusty ramblin' sack  
  
E D A  
I'm off to old Wyom
