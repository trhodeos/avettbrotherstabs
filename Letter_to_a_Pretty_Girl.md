# Letter to a Pretty Girl

(G)Hey hey (C)Carla  
It's a (D)long way to (G)Missouri  
(B7)From this (Em)highway  
(A7)East of Roa(D)noke  
(G)We had a (C)moment  
(D)That felt like (G)summer  
(B7)Now in (Em)slumber  
(A7)I can see your (D)smile  
We drive for miles  
Through corporate Ohio  
Rest stops in West Virginia  
Traffic in Washington DC  
  
(G)But of all the beauty that I've seen  
Played (F)out this window to the left of me  
(C)The thought of you it (Cm)shines  
(G)The (C)band plays (D)on, I keep the (G)time  
  
We play in the night time  
Awake before sunrise  
Wipe the sleep from my eyes  
Coffee my best friend  
You dance between classes  
Complete difficult assignments  
Wonder where the time went  
Out drinking with your friends  
  
We see a lot of beauty  
Some becomes ordinary  
Mountains, and canyons, and prairies  
Sunset over Chesapeake Bay  
Dear, dear Carla  
It's only that I'm askin'  
Make time more easy for the passin'  
If I knew I would see you again  
  
Of all the beauty that I see  
Out this window to the left of me  
The thought of you it shines  
The band plays on, I keep the time  
The time is marked, between the lines  
Hmmm... I keep the time
