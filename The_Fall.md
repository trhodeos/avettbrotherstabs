# The Fall

well (G)bring me something new, that i (C)haven't felt (G)before  
like messages of love and (D)directions to your door  
but (G)please talk slowly, I don't (C)hear good anymore  
and we (G)all (D)fall (C)down, yeah we (G)all (D)fall (G)down  
  
Don't die on me lady, only good things can come  
to those who practice reason, and recognize good fun  
your absence is the bullet the past is your gun  
and we all fall down  
  
well, she doesn't answer, though she knows that shes done wrong,  
we buried the memories, along with the songs,  
when she wakes up, I hope that we are gone,  
and we all fall down  
  
there's a visitor in black at my neighbors house,  
my neighbor says tomorrow the visitor says now,  
when he comes here, please tell him that I'm out  
and we all fall down
