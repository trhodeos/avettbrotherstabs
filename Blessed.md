(Am)Please don't (C)say I let you (G)down  
(Am)Well I've been (C)up for thirty (G)hours now  
And I just saw a shooting star  
Falling through an empty sky  
  
Tonight my memory's like a halo  
Hovering above my head  
Though my thoughts are filled with evil  
A silver cross hangs from my neck  
  
(G)They (C)never (D7)held my (G)hand  
I don't need them to hold it now  
They never called my name  
It's voice was quiet anyhow  
  
Bless me with your quiet singing  
And whisper music in my ears  
The best and worst thing about your memory  
Doesn't fade with the passing years  
  
And I remember something like love  
Passing, strolling, riding and rolling through my veins  
I know this talented young poet  
He said it all when he sang November:  
“The season blue remains”  
The season blue remains  
  
They never held my hand  
I don't need them to hold it now  
They never called my name  
It's voice was quiet anyhow
