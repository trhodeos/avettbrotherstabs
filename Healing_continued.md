Are there (F)times (F/G) (C)when you can't believe the (F)words? (F/G)  
(C)That are leaving your (F)mouth (F/G)  
Am I (C)making this (F)sound?  
Is it (C)me behind this (F)scream?  
(F)Is it (C)me behind this (F)yawn?  
  
Are there nights when your body won't get warm?  
In the middle of July  
Though you're curled up in a fire  
Is it you behind these lies?  
Your face a very good disguise  
  
Is this place everything that you described?  
Can it keep a person right?  
Can it bring the dead to life?  
Can it help the blind to see?  
Can it do the same for me?  
Can it do the same for me?  
Can it do the same for me?  
Can it do the same for me?  
  
Can it help the blind to see?  
Can it do the same for me?
