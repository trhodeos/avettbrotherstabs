# Awaiting The Flood

**Capo 4**  
  
(G)I hardly (B7)know (C)where to (G)begin  
(Am)Windows (G)open, (Am)sun falls (G)in  
I won't be going outside today  
I just don't want to get in the way  
And that's just what I'll be doing  
  
A plastic heart pumps no real blood  
It lies very still awaiting the flood  
Sleep well darling I'm on my way  
  
I saw your light a thousand miles from here  
It called me back but I went further still  
Across endless deserts and dying ground  
And (G)since this (B7)mornin' I (C)haven't made a (D7)sound
