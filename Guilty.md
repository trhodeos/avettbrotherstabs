# Guilty

My (F)mama is always trying  
And my (Am)sister is always hiding  
And my (Bb)brother is always (C)writing and (F)riding  
The (F)music is always playing  
No (Am)matter what I'm saying  
And my (Bb)mama is always (C)praying that we're (F)breathing  
That we're (Dm)breathing  
That we're (Bb)breathing  
  
The seasons are always changing  
And my love's always rearranging  
And my heart has just been hanging and waiting  
And our lives aren't burning  
And our world isn't turning  
And I don't know about love but I'm learning  
But I'm learning  
But I'm learning  
  
They say words cannot hurt us  
But I sat through the service  
And I don't know why this preacher makes me nervous  
They say time heals the wounded  
They say time heals the sorry  
But I ask you can time heal the guilty  
If your guilty  
Like I'm guilty
