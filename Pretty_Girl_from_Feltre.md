# Pretty Girl from Feltre

(C)Sus(F)anna(C) (F)Italia(C)nia (F)what do you (C)want to (G)do  
(C)I (F)thought (C)I had (F)figured it (C)out  
But (F)that was (C)before you(G)  
(Am)Walking a (G)mile into (C)town  
(Am)Hoping to (G)see you (C)around  
(Am)Hoping your (G)man is (F)nowhere to be found  
and (Am)hoping we'll (G)go to your (C)room  
and (Am)hoping we'll (G)go to your (C)room  
  
Quietly act like you love me until I leave Feltre  
And when you learn of my return  
Watch what the townspeople say  
Riding in your cargo van  
Driving your mom's cargo van  
If you only knew how charming it was  
The lure of your folks cargo van  
The lure of your folks cargo van  
  
Go tell Max  
Be clear with the facts  
Leave me a letter there  
I still have the one from before  
From when I turned twenty four
