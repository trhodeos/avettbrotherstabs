# My Losing Bet

G Bm C D  
  
G Bm C D G  
I waited for you, a hard thing to do  
Bm C D Bm C D  
knowin' we're through, and I don't have to choose,  
G Em Am D  
to welcome you back or push you away  
G Bm C D G Bm C D  
but wait we're not there yet, and though I'm losing the bet  
G  
there's still the sunset  
G A B  
C G D G  
I felt so surprise, when she arrived, wearing a smile,  
C G D  
smiles soon turn to tears, out on her back pier,  
G  
after all the love how how'd I end here.  
oh lord oh lord...
