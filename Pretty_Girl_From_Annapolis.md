Oh don't you (F)look at (G)me that (C)way  
I would be (F)honest but (G)I don't know (C)how to (Am)say  
I've been (F)lazy (G)with my (C)love  
Can't you (F)give me a (G)chance to (C)make it (Am)up to (F)you? (G)  
  
I'm always (F)chasing (G)some far off (C)dream  
My lady I (F)know it's not (G)easy for (C)you to (Am)see  
But I've (F)lied (G)to (C)myself  
And your (F)loveli(G)ness no (C)it doesn't (Am)help  
No your (F)beautiful (G)smile don't (C)help  
  
(Am)My (G)dreams are (C)lies  
(Am)That (G)I have (F)tried to (C)ignore  
(Am)My (G)dreams fly (C)me  
to a (F)place (G)near (C)Baltimore  
  
And I love this moment we're in  
Though we may not ever see this moment again  
may you find all that you need  
an easy way to forget about me  
may you forget about me  
  
And if we don't make it to the spring  
May you catch the joy that a melody brings  
from my dear brothers ragged six string  
Singing the songs we're embarassed to sing  
may you never be embarassed to sing
