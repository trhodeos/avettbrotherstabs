(C)If I get (Cadd9)murdered in the (Am)city (G)  
(F)don't go reve(G)nging in my (C)name  
(C)One person (Cadd9) dead from such is (Am) plenty (G)  
(F)No need to (G) go get locked (C) away.  
(Am)When I (G) leave your (C) arms  
(Am)the things that (G) I think (C) of  
(Am)No need to (G) get (F) over (C) alarmed  
(C)I'm (G) coming home (C)  
  
I wonder which brother is better  
which one our parents loved the most  
I sure did get in lots of trouble  
They seemed to let the other go  
A tear fell from my fathers eye  
I wondered what my dad would say  
(Am)He'd say I (G) love you and I'm (F) proud of you (C) both  
In so (C) many (G) different ways(C)  
  
If I get murdered in the city  
Go read the letter in my desk  
Don't bother with all my belongings  
But pay attention to the list  
Make sure my sister knows I loved her  
Make sure my mother knows the same  
  
(Am)Always remem(G)ber there was (F) nothing worth (C) sharing  
like the (C) love that let us (G) share our name(C)
