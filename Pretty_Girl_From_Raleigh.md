(C)I susp(D)ect it was your (G)friends  
(C)Or was (D)it a (G)stra(G/F\#)nger(Em)  
(C)Convincing you that (D7)this was the (G)end (repeat intro)  
  
And I would like to thank you  
For coming round and doing this  
My nights have been pretty painful  
Losing that pain was always the trick  
  
You always said that I was lying  
That I was just a selfish man  
But I all ready gave it all away  
So you can let go of my selfish hand  
  
So bye bye bye bye bye  
I ain’t got time to watch you cry  
Cause I’ve been drinking seven hours now  
Sympathy is a waste of my high  
  
And I would like to say it hurts me (but it don’t)  
That I don’t know just what to do (but I do)  
But it don’t hurt when you’re just killing time  
I was killing time and I think that you knew
