(E)I was in love with your (A)beauty  
from the (E)day you walked my (B7)way  
oh how I (E)wish that was (A)enough to  
have (E)made me (B7)want to (E)stay  
  
see I'm as true as I try to be,  
and I must say my girl  
I tried the best to give to you  
all of the truest in the world  
  
but when I left your house that morning  
in that ragged thunderbird  
tried my best to fight the voices  
from the devils that i heard  
  
see there's a highway  
to the right of us  
I took it years ago  
and since a year ago,  
can't drive past,  
without turning down that road  
  
(G)and I (C)knew it,  
I never should have turned the wheel  
and I knew it,  
the voices calling me weren't real  
I knew it  
listen to theÂ ? man say  
I knew I was wrong  
  
so give me a try at describing  
just how difficult it is  
to kinda love two girls and figure out  
which one you miss  
  
to stumble away  
from your staircase with your perfume on my clothes  
I kinda loved two girls but now I kinda lost 'em both  
repeat chorus  
  
And if I could gather up the damage that I've rendered in my life  
Put it on a scale and weigh against the damage done that night  
Then it'd be safe to say the weight of all I did and didn't do  
Would surly float against the lightest wrong I ever did to you
