# Love Like the Movies

So you (G)want to (D)be in (C)love (D)like the (G)movies?  
But in the movies they're (D)not in (C)love at (G)all  
With a (Em)twinkle in their (D)eyes  
(B7)They're just sayin their (C)lines  
So we (G)can't (D)be in (C)love (D)like the (G)movies  
  
Now in the (B7)movies, they (C)make it look so (G)perfect  
And in the background they're always playing the right song  
And in the ending there's always a resolution  
But real life is more than just (G)two (D)hours (C)long  
Chorus  
  
Well you can freeze frame any moment from a movie  
Or run the whole damn thing backwards from reel to reel  
But I don't see one single solitary lie technician  
Or one single camera in this moonlit field  
I don't want to be in love like the movies  
Cuz in the movies they're not in love at all  
With a twinkle in their eyes  
They're just saying their lines  
So we can't be in love like the movies
