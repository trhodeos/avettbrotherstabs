# Getting Us All

(D)How much (Em)rum can I (C)hold?  
(D)How much (Em)rum can I (C)hold?  
(D)Just yester(Em)night I was (C)told  
(D)You better not (Em)drink when you're (C)old  
  
But of (G)course  
(Em)But of (Am)course  
(D)Age gets us (G)all  
  
How many times will you hear?  
The funeral sounds in your ear  
I'm listening in my lowest gear  
And fading in my lowest gear  
  
But of course  
But of course  
Death gets us all  
  
And of course  
But of course  
Death gets us all  
  
Seven whole years have now passed  
Since I said that we would not last  
Though sometimes we ran out of gas  
And walked because no one would stop  
  
And I hope  
Yes I hope  
Love gets us all  
And I hope  
Yeah I hope  
Love gets us all
