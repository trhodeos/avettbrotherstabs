# A Fine Melody

Iâ€™ll never  
be the same  
As I was  
When you knew me  

  
That boy  
He is dead  
Killed in battle  

In a war  
That was fought  
Here in the winter  

On your porch  

  
Make me believe  
That you still  
Still love me  

Like you did  
Years ago  
When you knew me  

When you knew me  

  
I watched the planes  
Fly away  
Like your memory  

Landing hard  
In my head  
On my pillow  

  
Well my life has changed  
So much  
But your such  
A fine memory  

And my song has changed  
So much  
But your such  
A fine melody

  
Ok, I love you  

Of course, I love you  

Ok, I love you  

Of course, I love you  

  
I watched the planes  
Fly away  
Like your memory
