# Some Bad Dream

You walk(G) just like a girl that I (Bm)knew (C) (D7)  
(C)Same (D7)blue (G)dress  
(C)Same (D7)sweet (G)mess of a (Em)girl that I'm (Am)sure you (D7)are  
  
You were the (G)last to (Em)arrive  
The (Am)last one (D7)alive  
The (G)last in my (Em)car when I'm (Am)too drunk to (D7)drive  
The (G)first on my (Em)list of (Am)things I should (D7)keep  
The (G)last one (Em)around when I'm (Am)falling (D7)asleep  
  
You laugh just like a girl that I knew  
Same sweet sound  
Same sweet feet on the ground that I'm walking by  
I am suprised by the way that this makes me feel  
Suprised by the kings in the spokes of my wheels  
I wouldn't slow down if I thought you could see  
The last thing I need is to be stuck out here  
I am the last on your mind when you start to cry  
The last one to tell you I'm too young to die  
The last one to downplay my love for a girl  
The last in the paper for saving the world  
  
You are just what I want you to be  
Some bad dream  
Jarred me out of a sleep that I don't really need  
You were the last to arrive  
The last one alive  
The last in my car when I'm too drunk to drive  
The first on my list of things I should keep  
The last one around when I'm falling asleep
