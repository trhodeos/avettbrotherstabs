And how I want to love you (D\#)back(A\#)(D\#)  
  
People, people, people, they make it sound so easy  
They say just do what your heart tells you to  
But sometimes you cannot feel it  
Sometimes you cannot hear it  
Sometimes it won’t talk back to you  
And yeah I know you love me  
And yeah I want to love you back  
And how I know you love me  
And how I want to love you bad  
  
(G\#)Far away I hear the rhythm of a (D\#)song  
(G\#)Far away I get the feeling I (D\#)belong, and so do (A\#)you
(A\#)(A)(G\#)  
And it goes like this(A\#)  
  
Solo. I'll have this up very soon\!  
Chords are same as one verse and one chorus  
  
Oh no, no, don’t want to leave you  
Oh no, I want to keep you  
Oh but I want to let you be  
Oh no, I don’t want to hear you  
Say I don’t want to be near you  
Oh but I’ve got to set you free  
And how I know you love me  
And how I want to love you back  
And yeah I know you love me  
And yeah I want to love you bad  
  
Far away I hear the rhythm of a song  
Far away I get the feeling I belong, and so do you  
And it goes like this  
  
(A\#)La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, (G\#)la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
