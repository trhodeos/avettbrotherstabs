# Shame

(G)Ok so I was wrong about  
(Am)My reasons for us falling out  
(D)Of love I want to fall back (G)in  
  
(G)My life is different now I swear  
(Am)I know now what it means to care  
(D)about somebody other than (G)myself  
  
I know the things I said to you  
they were untender and untrue  
I'd like to see those things undo  
  
So if you could find it in your heart  
to give a man a second start  
I promise things wont end the same  
  
(G)Shame  
boatloads of (C)shame  
day after (Am)day  
more of the (D)same  
(G)blame  
please lift it (C)off  
please take it (Am)off  
please make it (D)stop  
  
Ok so I have read the mail  
The stories people often tell  
About us that we never knew  
  
But their existence will float away  
Just like every word they say  
And we will hold hands as they fade  
  
Chorus  
  
(C)I was so sure of everything(Bm)  
My love for you so well received(Em)  
And I just strutted ‘round your town(A)  
Knowing I didn’t let you down(C)  
The truth be known the truth be told(Bm)  
My heart was always fairly cold(Em)  
Posing to be as warm as yours(A)  
My way of getting in your world(C)  
But now I’m out and I’ve had time(Bm)  
To look around and think and  
(Am)See into another world that’s (D)filled with guilt and overwhelming
(G)shame  
  
Chours  
  
And everyone they have a heart  
And then they break and fall apart  
Beneath somebody’s helping hand  
  
I used to say just let ‘em fall  
It wouldn’t bother me at all  
I couldn’t help then now I can
