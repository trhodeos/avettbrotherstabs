(G)Somebody get my shotgun, somebody get my (C)blade  
(G)sally's been layin' with another man, he's (D)sleeping in my
(G)place  
  
somebody get my shotgun, gonna shot him sure as rain  
you can run as fast as you want to boy, I'll kill you just the same  
  
Somebody get my pocket blade, I'm gonna cut him don't you know  
you can try to hide all you want to, there ain't nowhere to go  
  
Somebody get my shotgun, somebody get my blade  
sally's been layin' with another man, he's sleeping in my place  
  
Now Sally don't go thinkin' that you got off so clean,  
I'd kill you too if I had the nerve, but I just ain't that mean  
  
So I go and get my murder tools, I throw them in the lake  
gonna steal me an automobile and drive so far away  
  
now I am a fugitive, I'm always on the run  
Sally told the policeman, exactly what I'd done  
  
I went and got my shotgun, went and got my blade  
killed poor Sally's lover, and buried him in the grave.  
  
Now all you ramblin' fellas, you listen close to me  
That woman gonna bring you pain, your heart is gonna bleed  
  
but it ain't worth the trouble, the sympathy or the grief  
but a bleeding heart is better than the penitentiary  
  
I killed Sally's love, one dark and dreary day  
Sally got another and I got sent away  
  
Somebody get my shotgun, somebody get my blade  
Sally's been laying with another man and I sent him to the grave.
