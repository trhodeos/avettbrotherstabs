(Am)Kill the doubt that (C)strangles myself (G)worth  
(Am)Paint the picture (C)that I swore I (G)heard  
  
Spiritless and mean  
Ghost that comes between  
I will keep my wits about myself  
Disregard directions sent from hell  
  
When it brings the gleam  
Longer lasting than me  
Oh my love but we are bound to die  
My heart is broke but you won't hear me cry  
Oh my love but we are bound to die  
My heart is broke but you won't see me
