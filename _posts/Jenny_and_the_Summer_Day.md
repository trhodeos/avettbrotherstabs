# Jenny and the Summer Day

(G)What a darling summer time  
I (A)have a car, I have a (C)dime, (G)baby, (D)baby  
I know that wont buy anything  
But I would steal you anything, baby, baby  
  
The (G)sun is hot, the (G7)wind is cool  
And (A)we are finally (C)outta school, (G)baby, (D)baby  
Well I'm in love, what can I say  
With Jenny and the summer day, baby, baby, baaaaby  
  
What a darling summer time  
Come on in, the water's fine, baby, baby  
I know that you're afraid to swim  
So I'll stay in the shallow end, baby, baby  
  
The sun is hot, your touch is cool  
And we are finally outta school, baby, baby  
Well, I'm in love what can I say  
  
(C)The sunlight burned my fear (D)away, (G)baby, (D)baby, (G)baaaby  
(G)Ninety and (Bm)rising  
(C)Soon we'll have to (D)hide out in the (G)shade  
(G)Somewhere, it's (Bm)raining, and (C)baby I can (D)almost hear you
(G)say  
That you (Bm)love (C)me and the (D)summer day(G)(D)  
That you (Bm)love (C)me(D)(G)(D)  
  
What a darling summer time  
I have a home in Carolina, baby, baby  
Not far from the city lights  
but we can see the stars at night, baby, baby  
  
The day was hot, tonight is cool  
And we are finally outta school, baby, baby  
Well, I'm in love what can I say  
With Jenny and the summer day, baby, baby, baaaby  
  
Ninety and rising  
Soon we'll have to hide out in the shade  
Somewhere, it's raining, and baby I can almost hear you say  
That you love me and the summer day  
That you love me
