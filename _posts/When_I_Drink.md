# When I Drink

**Capo 4 (Capo 2 on Album)**  
  
(C)When I (Am)drink  
I (F)say things I (G)don't want to (Am)(C/B)(C)say  
I (F)do things I (G)dont want to (C)(C/B)(Am)do  
I (F)talk mean to (G)you  
  
But if I think  
I just might get somethin out of this  
My parents taught me to learn when I miss  
Just do your best  
Just do your best  
  
It's the (Em)only way to keep that (F)last bit of sanity  
(Am)Maybe I dont have to be (G)good  
But I can try to be  
At (F)least a little better than I've (G)been so far  
  
But when I drink  
I hear things that aren’t really there  
I feel things when I shouldn’t- really care  
have fist fights with the air  
But if I think  
about someone other be--sides myself  
I live through the silver and the beeeeeeeeeells  
With something to tell  
Just do your best  
  
It’s the only way to keep that last bit of sanity  
Maybe I don't have to be good  
But I can try to be  
At least a little better then I've been So far  
But When I drink  
I spend the next morning in a haze  
\--But we only get so many days  
Now I have one less  
Just do your best  
  
It’s the only way to keep that last bit of sanity  
Maybe I don't have to be good  
But I can try to be  
At least a little better then I've been so far
