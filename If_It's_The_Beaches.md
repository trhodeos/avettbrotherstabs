# If It's The Beaches

**Capo 5**  
  
(C)Don't say it's over  
Cause that's the (Am)worst news I could (F)hear I swear that (C)I will  
Do my (Am)best to be here (F)just the way you (C)like it  
Even (C)though its hard to (F)hide  
Push my (C)feelings all (F)aside  
I will (C)rearrange my (F)plans and change for (C)you  
  
If I could go back  
That's the first thing I would do I swear that I would  
Do my best to follow through  
Come up with a master plan  
A homerun hit, a winning stand  
A guarantee and not a promise  
That I'll never let your love slip from my hands  
  
If it's the beaches  
If it's the beaches' sands you want  
Then you will have them  
If it's the mountains' bending rivers  
Then you will have them  
If it's the wish to run away  
Then I will grant it  
Take whatever what you think of  
While I go gas up the truck  
Pack the old love letters up  
We will read them when we forget why we left here
