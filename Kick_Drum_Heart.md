(C)The footprints over the snow  
the fabric of all the (F)lonely  
Covering (G)only  
the fables and (C)hands  
the rest is out in the cold  
holding the last of the (F)season  
F-F-F (G)freezzin'  
  
(F)My my my (G)hearts like a (Am)kick drum  
My hearts like a kick drum  
My hearts like a kick drum  
(F)My (G)loves like a (C)foot.  
  
We're walkin' in to the fields.  
We're walkin in to the forest.  
The moon is before us.  
Up above  
We're holdin' hands in the rain  
Sayin words like I love you  
Cha Cha do you love me?  
  
My hearts like a kick drum  
My hearts like a kick drum  
My hearts like a kick drum  
My loves like a foot  
  
(F)Mother Mary (C)Heard us (C/B)approaching her (Am)door  
(F)Though we (C)didn't (C/B)make a (Am)sound.  
  
There's nothing like finding gold  
within the rocks and the coal  
I'm so surprised to find more  
Always surprised to find more  
  
I won't look back anymore  
I left the people that do  
Its not the chase that I love  
Its me following you.  
  
Chorus
