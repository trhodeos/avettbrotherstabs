# Left on Laura, Left on Lisa

This is the chord played at the beginning and between the verses. Just a

(G)Nobody knows it but (C)I am so sad  
(G)Nobody knows it but (Bm)I am so sad  
(C)That is the (D)saddest of (G)all my girl  
(C)That is the (D)saddest of (G)all  
  
We climbed the ladder to the top of my house  
Never letting go of your hand  
The sky trades the moon for the sun my girl  
The sky trades the moon for the sun  
  
And I gave to you my ugly brown coat  
You made it pretty when you put it on  
Warmth in the early morning chill my girl  
Warmth in the early April  
  
Then you said you’d trade the love of a man  
Tears fell soft from your face to my hands  
Said you’d trade your heart for mine my girl  
I traded my heart for those days  
  
And you made it clear it was strictly a deal  
Of springtime love and that’s how I should feel  
So I set the clock back an hour my girl  
I set the time a just right  
  
You see somewhere back there when I was boy  
Furious I had become by the point  
That men are just liars and thieves of sorts  
Men are just liars and thieves  
  
But I still believe and I stand by my words  
I don’t know what you have seen or you’ve heard  
But somebody’s lying to you my girl  
Somebody’s lying to you  
  
You nearly made me believe I could stay  
Armed with you actions in part what you said  
But that was just foolish pride my girl  
And those are only feelings inside  
  
So I’m going back to the place where we met  
I’m going to find the beer bottle we left  
Wedged in the limbs of the tree that we sat in  
Wedged in the magnolia tree  
  
Well we hid for days like a proud pair of thieves  
Too sure we were right too stubborn to leave  
Wasted with the moment we lifted my girl  
Stolen forever with you
